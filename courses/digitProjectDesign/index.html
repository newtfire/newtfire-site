            <h2>Digital Project Design: Course Description</h2>

            <p>This course is all about working with computers and digital technology to build
               cultural resources on the public web. In taking this course you will gain experience
               with digital interface design and digital production, and you will learn a variety of
               coding and design skills for systematic building and sharing of information
               resources. Each semester this course is offered, the specific technologies and
               project topics may change, but the general goal is to learn new skills for designing
               interfaces that are effective for portfolios and complex projects.</p>

            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming,
               digital project management, and website interface development. The coursework is
               intended to build on prior project development experience in previous DIGIT classes
               with a foundation in XML stack development, and should give you opportunities to
               refine, polish, and develop more complex approaches to web interface development.
               Through your project work in this class, you will gain skills in thinking
               algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions. Your digital
               projects will distinguish you as investigators and creators, able to wield computers
               creatively and effectively for human interests. As always, our goal in DIGIT is not
               to make you expert programmers (as I am far from that myself). Instead, we want you
               to learn how to apply coding technologies for your own purposes, how to track down
               answers to questions, how to ask for help, and how to find answers to questions by
               searching and experimenting. </p>

            <div id="grading">

               <h2>Grading:</h2>
               
              <h3>Portfolio Development (25%)</h3>
               <p>This portion of your grade includes preparation of material for seeking a professional career. It includes
               work toward writing and revising resumes, preparing for career fairs, investigating professional advanced graduate study opportunities.</p>
               
               
               <h3>Coding Homework Exercises (25%)</h3>
               <p>Coding homework is for developing skills that are foundational for professional web development. 
                  Homework is <strong>time-sensitive</strong> and
                  due before class begins. Therefore, points are awarded based on engagement with
                  the assignment and timeliness of completion:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>If the homework is completed before class and demonstrates thoughtful
                     engagement, it is awarded a full 3 points.</li>
                  <li>If it is completed by the end of the day after reviewed in class, it can earn
                     no more than 2 points.</li>
                  <li>If completed within the week assigned or before a test on the unit in which it
                     is assignned, it can be worth a maximum of 1 point.</li>
                  <li>Unless a special arrangement has been made with me, homework submitted after
                     the test for its unit is worth no points, though you may wish to complete it to
                     review a concept or method for work on a project.</li>
                  <li>The homework portion of the course grade reflects the percentage of work
                     completed in a timely manner with some flexibility. If you complete 90% of the
                     homework on time, you will receive an A in this portion of the course grade.
                     Homework does not have to be perfect to be awarded full credit.</li>
                  <li>If the class opts to do team projects, students are not eligible to join a project team if they have not completed a majority of the homework when the class forms project teams.</li>
               </ul>
               
               <h3>Tech World Research (25%)</h3>
               <p>A portion of your grade is devoted to researching issues affecting digital technologies, and preparing a web resource that orients digital creatives to these issues with guidance on how to navigate them. You will accumulate and share an online, linked bibliography and prepare creative material designed as a community support resource for designers and developers.  
               </p>
               
               
               <h3>Digital Project Development (25%)</h3>
               
               <p>You will be working on designing professional web resources using JavaScript, SVG, and other web technologies,
                  building on the homework assignments to culminate in a new achievement based on skills you are learning in this course.</p>
               
               <p><strong>Project Milestones</strong> There will be a series of project milestones
                  to complete by due dates set throughout the semester. Each milestone is worth a
                  portion of the project grade ( and earns a letter grade on the following scale:
                  <q>exceeds target</q> (A+), <q>meets target</q> (A), <q>some progress</q> (B),
                  <q>negligible progress</q> (C), <q>no progress</q>(F). Each checkpoint will
                  expect you to complete a stage of serious work on the course project with your
                  project team. Project Checkpoints are met using the Issues and/or Projects tabs on
                  your project GitHub repository and by posting files on the project website on
                  newtFire. </p>
               
               
               <p>Course projects are fully assembled in the
                  final weeks of the course and submitted in two places, through code and
                  documentation shared in your GitHub repository and on your project website due in
                  Finals Week. Projects are evaluated as a team effort, but if unequal effort is
                  observed, project members may receive different project grades accordingly. </p>



               <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>

               <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
                  scale: A: 93-100%, A-: 90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C:
                  70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
                  basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. </p>


            </div>
            <div id="policies">
               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>

               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response posts, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to Canvas (or GitHub
                  or our web server as specified), by the due date and time indicated on the class
                  schedule. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website and
                  linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected to
                  consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will usually not
                  accept late homework submissions. </p>
               <h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>Attendance is about connecting and being part of our class community of coders. I
                  expect your active presence and interaction with me and your classmates this
                  semester, because we need to rely on each other in the classroom and online in our
                  coding environemnts to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>This class is fast-paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the
                  important collective mental activity of class. So does in-class texting and
                  checking your cell phone. During classtime, I ask that you put mobile devices in
                  Do Not Disturb mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the
                  classroom, texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or
                  other distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>

               <h3>When you must be absent from class</h3>
               <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
                  not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
                  person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
                  professor as well as to you!</p>
               <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, it is your responsibility to make
                  arrangements with me and your peers to catch up. We will always be connected in
                  some way on line (via e-mail, Slack chat, and GitHub asynchronously) and we will
                  find ways to keep you looped in.</p>

               <h4>Student (and Faculty) Health and Wellness Services</h4>
               <p>If any of us, you students or me, are feeling seriously ill this semester, please

               <h3>Equity</h3>
               <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
                  students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
                  due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
                  race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
                  and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/"
                  >http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
               <h3>E-mail:</h3>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to <a href="https://accounts.psu.edu/"
                     >https://accounts.psu.edu/</a>, log into your account, click on Edit Forwarding
                  Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be sure to log out of your
                  account when you have finished. </p>

               <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
               <p> Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, puts a very high value on academic
                  integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
                  scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
                  is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State
                  University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
                  accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
                  Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
                  respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
                  an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
                  Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
                  community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
                  deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of
                  the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.”
                  (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures. Any violation of academic integrity will
                  receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
                  awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
                  failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
                  academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
                  accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a
                     href="http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity"
                     >http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity</a>. </p>
               <p>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the
                  affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic
                  Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be
                  expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found
                  responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be
                  severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include
                  ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness.
                  Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The
                  Schreyer Honors College.</p>

                  <p><strong>Here is Penn State’s recommended policy on academic integrity and
                        generative technology:</strong> If your instructor allows you to use ideas,
                     images, or word phrases created by another person or by generative technology,
                     such as ChatGPT, <em>you must identify their source</em>. You may not submit
                     false or fabricated information or use the same academic work for credit in
                     multiple courses. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask
                     their instructor <em>before submitting work</em>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Here is how we will approach work with AI and generative technology in
                        this class:</strong> Sometimes we will experiment with it, and I will
                     specifically ask you to try something with AI. When I do that, there will
                     always be something more that I ask you to do to reflect on the output and work
                     with or build on it in some way. I will expect you to <em>explain and document
                        your process</em>: what you are doing with the AI. If your method of
                     preparing an assignment involves chat-generative AI, <em>include a link to the
                        chat transcript</em> in your assignment when you submit it. Here is some
                     helpful guidance from the MLA on <a

               </section>
               <p>
                  <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to credit sources in digital contexts, including applications
                  of artificial intelligence. We will consider how and why such citations differ
                  from documenting printed texts. Our emphasis is on providing a clear information
                  trail for a digital resource: where is it hosted? When was it last updated, and
                  when did you access it? Who is responsible for maintaining the resource? We will
                  also consider the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are
                  plagiarized on the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations
                  detracts from the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to
                  practice mindful source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very
                  serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in <q>helping</q> you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                     <q>copy</q> and <q>paste</q> features as you read and research, be sure that
                  you are carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source,
                  so that you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy
                  work but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As
                  long as you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not
                  be faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration. We
                  have adopted our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course, like ours, involves daily coding assignments and team projects.
                  This policy specifies that students identify collaborators in a comment on
                  submitted asignments and take care on projects that all students contribute
                  equally (and no student is contributing excessively more than what everyone else
                  has done). When joining a group homework session, always work on the assignment by
                  yourself first so you can be an equal participant, and write up the assignment
                     <em>by yourself, after</em> the session is over so you take care not to copy
                  from the other students. While we want you to consult with each other, you are
                  responsible for doing all your writing and coding by yourself, using your own
                  words. </p>
