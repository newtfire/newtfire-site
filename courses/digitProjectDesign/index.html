            <h2>Digital Project Design: Course Description</h2>
            
            <p>This course is all about working with computers and digital technology to build cultural resources on the public web. In taking this course you will gain experience with digital interface design and digital production, and you will learn a variety of coding and design skills for systematic building and sharing of information resources. Each semester this course is offered, the specific technologies and project topics may change, but the general goal is to learn new skills for designing interfaces that are effective for portfolios and complex projects.</p>

            <p>Students who complete this course will gain skills in practical hands-on programming,
               digital project management, and
               website interface development. The coursework is intended to build on prior project development experience in previous DIGIT classes with a foundation in XML stack development, and should give you opportunities to refine, polish, and develop more complex approaches to web interface development. Through your project work in this class, you will gain skills in thinking algorithmically (step-by-step) through problems to find good solutions. 
               Your digital projects will distinguish you as investigators
               and makers, able to wield computers creatively and effectively for human interests.
               As always, our goal in DIGIT is not to make you expert programmers (as I am far from
               that myself). Instead, we want you to learn how to apply coding technologies for
               your own purposes, how to track down answers to questions, how to ask for help, and how to find answers to questions by searching and experimenting.
            </p>

                     <li>Create digital editions: Build a website that curates a collection 
                        and investigates a significant research question about that collection.

                     <li>Reflect and write on the issues and problems with digital representation,
                        as well as the capacity of the digital medium to enhance or add dimensions
                        to a physical text.
                     </li>
                     
                     
                     <li>Practice the range of coding connected to the XML stack and text processing to <q>mark up</q>, extract, and visualize information about
                        the structure, physical condition, and cultural contexts of media artifacts.

                        than we could do
                        <q>manually</q> or with unassisted eyes and brains. 
                     </li>
                     
                     <li>Practice <q>autotagging</q> collections of texts for
                        practical results: to code the structure of enormous texts from a distance,
                        in order to navigate them and make them accessible through distant
                        reading.

            <h3>Homework Exercises (40%):</h3>
            
            <p>To keep up with this class, you must work on exercises regularly. Each day will
               involve some small assignment, to prepare you for the next of class, and to help
               you to build your course project. Homework is <strong>time-sensitive</strong> and due before class begins. Therefore, points are awarded based on engagement with the assignment and timeliness of
               completion:</p>
            <ul><li>If the homework is completed before class and demonstrates thoughtful engagement, it is awarded a full 3 points.</li> 
               <li>If it is completed by the end of the day after reviewed in class, it can earn no more than 2 points.</li> 
               <li>If completed within the week assigned or before a test on the unit in which it is assignned, it can be worth a maximum of 1 point.</li>
               <li>Unless a special arrangement has been made with me, homework submitted after the test for its unit is worth no points, though you may wish to complete it to review a concept or method for work on a project.</li>
               <li>The homework portion of the course grade reflects the percentage of work completed in a timely manner with some flexibility. If you complete 90% of the homework on time, you will receive an A in this portion of the course grade. Homework does not have to be perfect to be awarded full credit.</li>
               <li>Students are not eligible to join a project team (see Project portion of the grade) if they have not completed a majority of the homework when the class forms project teams.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
               <strong>About homework assignments:</strong>  Coding and project review exercises in this course are about your <strong>active learning</strong>, and not—as in other
               courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in
               class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something
               that you don’t already know how to do. Often there will be multiple ways of accomplishing
               the task and I am not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one
               way. Instead, I am looking for signs of your active learning process as you take on a
               challenge. Documenting problems is key to learning, and sometimes just writing out
               what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! There may be
               times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected!
               In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious
               attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried,
               what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting
               stuck is part of the learning process. You will see me get stuck sometimes, and I will need <em>your eyes</em> to help me fix something!
               As long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts
               to resolve it on your own, you will do well: documentation of how you get stuck is key. One of our goals is to form a supportive coding community in this class, so we are comfortable with <em>unsticking</em> each other. 
            </p>
            
            <p>I may ask you to <strong>redo</strong> an assignment for partial credit. If you are asked to redo an assignment it is considered incomplete or problematic. 
               If you resubmit a <q>redo</q> to correct a serious problem, you will likely (eventually) receive full credit for the assignment. 
               I will post comments for feedback and learning purposes and you will find these comments on Canvas, sometimes in your coded homework file. If you have
               not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or
               discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), I may
               ask you to meet with me to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task
               in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, I will invite you to
               review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do
               this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way.
               For some assignments where we review posted solutions together in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your
               specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. When much of the class is <q>stuck</q> on something, we will go over assignments together in class, too. If I don’t return
               your assignment, that means that I found nothing to add to our posted solution. In those cases, if you have any questions about your work after reading the posted solution or reviewing our class discussion, please ask. 
            </p>
            
            
            <h3>Presence and Connection: In Class and Virtual (15%):</h3>
            
            <p> This portion of your grade reflects your engagement in in-class actvities and in discussions and informal work with me and your DIGIT peers in multiple classes as they are learning their way. As usual, we will be working in virtual messaging mediums via GitHub and Slack. This portion of the grade considers your regular presence for in-class activities as well as your connection with the class in online environments. Coding and programming in real life is a social activity. Professionals in
               the Real World aren’t <q>know-it-all</q> experts who work alone! Instead they are tuned
               in to discussion boards and they regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
               learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
               to each other, to students in the lower-level classes, and me as your community resources.
               Earn an <q>A</q> in this category by participating in class discussion assignments, monitoring and responding to posts in the DIGIT-Coders Slack, regularly asking questions, making suggestions, or sharing helpful resources you’ve found.</p>
            <p>
               <strong>Discussion posts:</strong> Throughout the course, I will assign discussion posts on Canvas, Slack, or <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub">our class GitHub site</a> in which you will respond to online readings or evaluate web resources. Your posting
               should do more than
               summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
               the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
               specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
               or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
               or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
               you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
               details of specific interest.
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>GitHub and Slack</strong>: Early in the course, I will ask you to connect to the DIGIT-Coders Slack chat (which you have joined in previous classes). If you have a question about an assignment, try reaching out to your peers on Slack first, and think of this as a way to earn credit toward Presence and Connection. Others may have the
               same question and answers are best shared! (Of course you may e-mail me, but I may respond by asking that you take a question to your peers first. Also, the Slack group includes students from multiple DIGIT courses and our DIGIT tutors, who who may be able to help more quickly than I can by myself! 
            </p>
            
            
            
           <!-- <h3>Tests (20%):</h3>
            
            <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be several (probably about five or six)
               tests on the various kinds of coding we are learning in the course, and we will drop
               the lowest grade.  All will be take-home or taken online in between classes.
               They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed individually and are designed
               to demonstrate that you have learned from the class material, coding assignments,
               and posted solutions.  Tests may resemble homework assignments, but unlike homework
               exercises, these are given letter grades. These are given grades because they are
               evaluative and involve demonstrating what you have learned after we have finished
               a coding unit.
            </p>-->
            
            
            
            <h3>Projects and Milestones (45%):</h3>
            
            <p>Throughout the semester you will be working solo and in teams on multiple projects.
                Teams will form around a selection of these projects
               in mid-September and begin work, performing document analysis, developing and implementing
               a system of markup and project rules, marking up text following that system, writing
               programs to conduct research and create a resource to share on a public website you
               will develop together that represents your investigation and your conclusions. Each
               project team must meet regularly together and check in with me <!--and with a project mentor (one of the instructor
               team)--> outside of class for project planning and discussion. 
            </p> 
            
            <p><strong>Project Milestones</strong> There will be a series of project milestones to complete by due dates set throughout
               the semester. Each milestone is worth a portion of the project grade ( and earns a letter
               grade on the following scale:  <q>exceeds target</q> (A+), <q>meets target</q> (A), <q>some progress</q> (B), <q>negligible progress</q> (C), <q>no progress</q>(F). Each checkpoint will expect you to complete a stage of serious work on the course
               project with your project team. Project Checkpoints are met using the Issues and/or
               Projects tabs on your project GitHub repository and by posting files on the project
               website on newtFire.
            </p>
            
            
            <p>Course projects develops throughout the semester, but are fully assembled in the
               final weeks of the course and submitted in two places, through code and documentation
               shared in your GitHub repository and on your project website due in Finals Week. Projects
               are evaluated as a team effort, but if unequal effort is observed, project members
               may receive different project grades accordingly. 
            </p>
            
            
            
            
            
            
            
            <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
            
            <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
               scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
               90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
               basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit.

         <div id="policies">
               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>
           
               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response posts, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to Canvas (or
                  GitHub or our web server as specified), by the due date and time indicated on the
                  class schedule. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will usually not
                  accept late homework submissions. </p>
            <h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
            <p>Attendance is about connecting and being part of our class community of coders. 
               I expect your active presence and
               interaction with me and your classmates this semester, because we need to rely on each
               other in the classroom and online in our coding environemnts to learn and develop projects.</p>
            <p>This class is fast-paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
               our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early disrupts the important collective mental activity of class. So does
               in-class texting and checking your cell phone. During classtime, 
               I ask that you put mobile devices in Do Not Disturb
               mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the classroom,
               texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or other
               distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>
            
            <h3>When you must be absent from class</h3>
            <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
               not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
               person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
               professor as well as to you!</p>
            <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, it is your responsibility to make arrangements with me and
               your peers to catch up. We will always be connected in some way on line (via e-mail, Slack chat, and GitHub
               asynchronously) and we will find ways to keep you
               looped in.</p>

            <h3>Equity</h3>
            <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
               students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
               due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
               race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
               and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                  href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/">http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
            <h3>E-mail:</h3>
            <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
               admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
               communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
               account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
               in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
               the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
               service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
               (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
               psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
               result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
               communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
               your University account, go to <a href="https://accounts.psu.edu/">https://accounts.psu.edu/</a>, log into your account,
               click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
               sure to log out of your account when you have finished.  </p>
            
            <h3 id="integrity">Academic Integrity</h3>
            
            <p> Penn State puts a very high value on academic
               integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
               scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
               is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
               accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
               Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
               respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
               an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts. 
               Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
               community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
               deception. According to Penn State policy G-9: Academic Integrity, an academic integrity violation is <q>an intentional, unintentional, or attempted violation of course or assessment policies to gain an academic advantage or to advantage or disadvantage another student academically.</q> 
               (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures (found at <a href="https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html">https://undergrad.psu.edu/aappm/G-9-academic-integrity.html</a>).   Any violation of academic integrity will
               receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
               awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
               failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
               academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
               accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a
                  href="https://behrend.psu.edu/academics/academic-services/academic-integrity-students">https://behrend.psu.edu/academics/academic-services/academic-integrity-students</a>. </p>
            <p>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>
            <section class="sub"> <h4 id="textGenAI">Academic Integrity and Use of <q>AI</q> Text Generative Technology</h4>
               
               <p><strong>Here is Penn State’s recommended policy on academic integrity and generative technology:</strong> If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, <em>you must identify their source</em>. You may not submit false or fabricated information or use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor <em>before submitting work</em>.</p>
               <p><strong>Here is how we will approach work with AI and generative technology in this class:</strong> Sometimes we will experiment with it, and I will specifically ask you to try something with AI. When I do that, there will always be something more that I ask you to do to improve, repair, reflect on the output and use it in your building process. I will expect you to <em>explain and document your process</em>: what you are doing with the AI. If your method of preparing an assignment involves chat-generative AI, <em>include a link to the chat transcript</em> in your assignment when you submit it.</p>   
               
               
               <h4 id="citing">Source Citation, Plagiarism, and Coding</h4>
               <p>
                  One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the Worldwide Web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation including when you have engaged with artificial intelligence models. 
                  Failing to document your sources constitutes plagiarism and will have very serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in <q>helping</q> you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including generative AI, websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                  “copy” and “paste” features as you read and research, be sure that you are
                  carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that
                  you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work
                  but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As long as
                  you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be
                  faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and
                  for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course is very similar to ours. This policy specifies that students
                  identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on
                  projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing
                  excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework
                  session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal
                  participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session
                  is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to
                  consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding
                  by yourself, using your own words. </p></section>

                     and His Times</a>: The very thoughtful stylistic design of this important
                  project reproduces the style of nineteenth-century print and layout. The content
                  makes many rare materials about Lord Byron’s social network searchable and
                  connected to the web of linked open data.

                  digitizes the manuscripts of Percy and Mary Shelley, and Mary Shelley’s parents,
                  William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft—manuscripts often written in multiple
                  hands. Provides an important study of the Frankenstein notebooks to demonstrate
                  how much of a role Percy Shelley played in the writing of Frankenstein. The
                  archive provides a good model of the use of TEI for manuscript encoding and of
                  complex and multiple visualizations of manuscript texts.
