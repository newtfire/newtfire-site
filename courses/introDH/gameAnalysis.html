       <h1>Analyze a Video Game as an Alternate Immersive Reality</h1>
       <section id="gettingStarted">
           <h2>Choose your game</h2>
           <p>The worlds designed by artists and programmers (and artist-programmers) for video games can constitute an art form in and of themselves, requiring active learning and participation on the part of the game player. This assignment involves you in exploring the complexity of a genre of video games that immerse you in a constructed <q>Secondary World</q> with its own set of rules that define how you move, interact, solve problems, and explore its dimensions.</p>
        <p>Our assignment invites you to explore a game either made by <q>indie</q> designers posted freely in the game development and testing venue itch.io, or available over Steam. Choose a game to explore from <strong><a href="https://ebeshero.itch.io/">this collection on itch.io</a></strong>.</p></section>

     <h2>First stage of analysis</h2>
     <p>Begin by taking notes on the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look and listen in the game: What features (or <q>assets</q>) are helping to create an illusion of exploring a world? How simple or complex are the graphics and media?</li>
            <li>How simple or complex are the settings in the game? How far can you explore and what makes the settings distinctive?</li>
            <li>What kind(s) of character(s) are you invited to control? Are you invited to be multiple characters? Or just one character type?</li>
            <li>How do you get to know the character(s) you are playing? What details make them distinctive, quirky, memorable, etc?</li>
            <li>What kinds of interactions do you have with NPC characters?</li>
            <li>How are you challenged as a game player in this game? What are you being asked to investigate, where do you get stuck, and how do you make progress in the game?</li>
            <li>What kinds of objects do you interact with in the game? Do you pick up written messages, do you ever need to consume food in the game, do you pick up functional things you need to get other things work? </li>
            <li>Where (if ever) do you see the game comment on itself in a <q>meta</q> way as a fictional, constructed system (as a game)?</li>
            <li>Where and how do you see the game respond to or comment on our reality? Or what cultural issues from our world do you see reflected in this game?</li>
        </ul>
    <p>Take notes either on your computer or even hand-written on paper as you are playing the game. Type these up into a word document or a post on your own GitHub issues page on your personal repo. For this portion of the assignment, you will submit a Word document or a link to your GitHub issue as a first round of analysis of your game experience. </p></section>
        <section id="stage2">
            <h2>Write a review of a game on your website</h2>
            <p>Revisit your game and notes to convert these into a review of the game that you will post on one of the websites you have constructed for this class this semester. Take some screen captures to document your experience and use it to illustrate your review of the game.</p>
            <p>Your review should be several paragraphs long. These games are not necessarily well-known, though some are reasonably famous. Your goal is to introduce an interesting indie game to people who may be interested in trying it out. What aspects of the game do you find worthy of praise? What do you find problematic aobut it? Be sure to cover in your review the distinctive features of the game on which you took notes: Discuss the setting, the characters, objects in game and how you interact with them. Finally, think about this game as an art form, a real, immersive environment that might have some value and meaning to us in our world: why did this game interest you, or why might it be worth exploring for a little while?</p>

        <section id="stage3">
            <h2>Explore a second game</h2>
            <p>Choose a second game to explore as the very last stage of this assignment. Select this game as one that provides a significant contrast or seems worth comparing to the first game you discussed. Review this game to compare and/or contrast it with the first game you explored, and be sure to cover all the areas discussed above. Add this to your website posting to complete this assignment.</p>
