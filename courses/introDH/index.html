            <h2>Introduction to Digital Humanities: Course Description</h2>
            <p>This course is designed to provide students an immersive introductory experience of digital humanities, as an area of serious investigation, reflection, and creative play. Digital activities are central to everything we do in this course. We will explore how digital tools can change how we read and mediate what we see of the world. We will write markup and command line code to build a website and learn how to design your own digital structures. We will explore how to design for maximum accessibility: to reach people who do not see the same way or have access to the best technology. We may be exploring serious issues like compromised data and racial disparities cultivated by supposedly color-blind technology. We will experiment with text analysis tools to study patterns of language in digital text collections, and we will try out digital mapping tools to visualize space and time in informational graphics. Finally, we will play games: we will explore and review immersive realities by independent artist-designers sharing their work on the public web. Our course in digital humanities gives you hands-on experience with building and shaping projects on the free web in an age of bots and AI.</p>

               <h2>Grading:</h2>
               <h3>Readings, Short Assignments, and Participation (15%)</h3>
               <p>Throughout the course, we will be working on actively responding to readings using
                  the free online annotation tool Hypothes.is in your web browser. Annotations will be evaluated for clarity, accuracy, and and thoroughness in
                  responding to the assignment. We will also be doing short data collection and visualization exercises using a variety of digital tools. Your completion of these small assignments
               counts toward this portion of the course grade.</p>
              <!-- <h3>PSU Tech Academy Module (5%)</h3>
               <p>A series of online tutorials and exercises to orient you to Penn State tech resources, with a certificate to complete on Canvas.</p>
               <h3>PSU Academic Integrity Module (5%)</h3>
               <p>An online tutorial with exercises on academic integrity, with a certificate to complete on Canvas.</p>-->
               <h3>Website Development and Critique (25%)</h3>
               <p>You will be experimenting with developing a website in two different formats, one
                  using GitHub, widely used by coders and developers, and the other a more
                  conventional developing medium. This will involve developing content, based on
                  your choice of digital humanities topics we explore in the course, as well as
                  critique of the mode of designing a web resource. This also represents a
                  significant introductory foray in coding and development, familiarizing yourself
                  with digital systems of media publication.</p>
               <h3>Text Analysis (20%)</h3>
               <p>This grouping of assignments involves investigating digital tools for visualizing
                  patterns in texts, and exploring and critiquing web interfaces for reading textual
                  variants. Each of these will be accompanied by written critiiques illustrated with
                  labeled screen capture images to post on one of your websites.</p>
            <h3>Visualizing Space and Time (15%)</h3>
               <p>These assignments give you experience with visualizing information about places and events using story mapping software.</p>
               <h3>Secondary Worlds and Game Analysis (25%)</h3>
               <p>Explore the concept of secondary world building and its digital applications. You
                  will be assigned to play two "indie" games under development from a collection I
                  will provide the class, and write a comparative game review with labeled screen
                  capture images to post on one of your websites.</p>
               <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
               <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
                  scale: A: 93-100%, A-: 90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C:
                  70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
                  basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit. </p>

            <div id="policies">
               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>
 
               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your homework for this course is time-sensitive, because it is connected to a daily learning process. Within a unit in our class, we are always working in stages on a digital project. There will often be several <q>low-stakes</q> short assignments to help you along the way to building something complex and it will help you to receive some guidance along the way to completion, both in class and through my comments on Canvas. Homework assignments will be
                  posted online to our class website and linked from our Canvas site, so students
                  who miss class are expected to consult the schedule and submit assignments on
                  time. If you need more time on an assignment, write or talk to me about requesting
                  an extension.</p>
               <!--<h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
               <p>The exams will be take-home, to do on your own time, with submissions due in
                  Canvas  </p>-->
               <h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>Attendance is about showing up and connecting with our class as a community. I 
                  expect your active presence and interaction with me and your classmates
                  this semester, as we need to rely on each other to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>Our class moves quickly and requires that we all be making the best use we can of our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early (physically or
                  remotely!) disrupts the important collective mental activity of class. So does
                  in-class texting and checking your cell phone. During class time, 
                  I ask that you put mobile devices in Do Not Disturb
                  mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the classroom,
                  texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or other
                  distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>

               <h3>When you must be absent from class</h3>
               <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
                  not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
                  person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
                  professor as well as to you!</p>
               <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, it is your responsibility to make arrangements with me and
                  your peers to catch up. We will always be connected in some way on line (via e-mail, Slack chat, and GitHub
                  asynchronously) and we will find ways to keep you
                  looped in.</p>
               
               <h4>Student (and Faculty) Health and Wellness Services</h4>
               <p>If any of us, you students or me, are feeling seriously ill this semester, please contact the Behrend Student Health &amp;
                  Wellness Center at <b>814-898-6217</b>. Reporting in when you do not feel well is not shameful; it is responsible and
                  important to protect yourself and our community.</p>
               <h4>Counseling Services</h4>
               <p>Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs
                  that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional
                  well being. Seek help! 
                  The university offers a variety of confidential services to

                  Counseling Office in Reed Union Bldg. Rm 1: <strong>814-898-6504</strong>. </p>
               <h3>LionHELP</h3>
               <p>LionHELP is a smartphone application, available for both iOS and Android, that you can download if you or someone you know may be facing a mental health emergency. This app provides information about the signs of a mental health crisis, how to talk to someone who may be in crisis, a guide to help refer someone to the appropriate resource, and a full list of resources available on campus. The app can be downloaded free of charge, and there is absolutely no tracking of any information. Please note that LionHELP is not a diagnostic tool and should not take the place of services provided by a licensed mental health professional.</p>
               <h3>Equity</h3>
               <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
                  students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
                  due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
                  race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
                  and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
               <h3>E-mail:</h3>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to <a href="https://accounts.psu.edu/">https://accounts.psu.edu/</a>, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished.  </p>
               
               <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
               <p> Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, puts a very high value on academic
                  integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
                  scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
                  is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State
                  University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
                  accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
                  Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
                  respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
                  an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
                  Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
                  community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
                  deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of
                  the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.”
                  (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures. Any violation of academic integrity will
                  receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
                  awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
                  failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
                  academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
                  accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a
                     href="http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity"
                     >http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity</a>. </p>
               <p>Students facing allegations of academic misconduct may not drop/withdraw from the affected course unless they are cleared of wrongdoing (see G-9: Academic Integrity). Attempted drops will be prevented or reversed, and students will be expected to complete course work and meet course deadlines. Students who are found responsible for academic integrity violations face academic outcomes, which can be severe, and put themselves at jeopardy for other outcomes which may include ineligibility for Dean’s List, pass/fail elections, and grade forgiveness. Students may also face consequences from their home/major program and/or The Schreyer Honors College.</p>
               <section class="sub"> <h4 id="textGenAI">Academic Integrity and Use of <q>AI</q> Text Generative Technology</h4>
                  
                  <p><strong>Here is Penn State’s recommended policy on academic integrity and generative technology:</strong> If your instructor allows you to use ideas, images, or word phrases created by another person or by generative technology, such as ChatGPT, <em>you must identify their source</em>. You may not submit false or fabricated information or use the same academic work for credit in multiple courses. Students with questions about academic integrity should ask their instructor <em>before submitting work</em>.</p>
                  <p><strong>Here is how we will approach work with AI and generative technology in this class:</strong> Sometimes we will experiment with it, 
                     and I will specifically ask you to try something with AI. When I do that, there will always be something more that I ask you to do to reflect on the output and work with or build on it in some way. 
                     I will expect you to <em>explain and document your process</em>: what you are doing with the AI. If your method of preparing an assignment involves chat-generative AI, <em>include a link to the chat transcript</em> in your assignment when you submit it.
                     Here is some helpful guidance from the MLA on <a href="https://style.mla.org/citing-generative-ai">what to include in a citation of an AI assistant</a>.

                  <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to credit sources in digital contexts, including applications of artificial intelligence. 
                  We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. Our emphasis is on providing a clear information trail 
                  for a digital resource: where is it hosted? When was it last updated, and when did you access it? Who is responsible for maintaining the resource?
                  We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in <q>helping</q> you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                  <q>copy</q> and <q>paste</q> features as you read and research, be sure that you are
                  carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that
                  you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work
                  but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As long as
                  you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be
                  faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration. We have
                  adopted our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course, like ours, involves daily coding assignments and team projects. 
                  This policy specifies that students
                  identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on
                  projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing
                  excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework
                  session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal
                  participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session
                  is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to
                  consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding
                  by yourself, using your own words. </p>
