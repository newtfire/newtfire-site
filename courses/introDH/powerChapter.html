Several months earlier, in March of that year, Williams had accidentally announced her pregnancy to the world via a bathing suit selfie and a caption that was hard to misinterpret: “20 weeks.” Now, they thought, her baby had finally arrived.</p><p id="nti2ija7edp">But then they waited, and waited some more. Two weeks later, Williams finally reappeared, announcing the birth of her daughter and inviting her followers to watch a video that welcomed Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. to the world.<a href="#fn-0-bottom" id="fn-0-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Serena Williams, “Meet Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. You have to check out link in bio for her amazing journey. Also check out my IG stories 😍😍❤❤,” September 13, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/BY-7H9zhQD7/&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/BY-7H9zhQD7/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">1</a> The video was a montage of baby bump pics interspersed with clips of a pregnant Williams playing tennis and having cute conversations with her husband, Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, and then, finally, the shot that her fans had been waiting for: the first clip of baby Olympia. Williams was narrating: “So we’re leaving the hospital,” she explains. “It’s been a long time. We had a lot of complications. But look who we got!” The scene fades to white, and the video ends with a set of stats: Olympia’s date of birth, birth weight, and number of grand slam titles: 1. (Williams, as it turned out, was already eight weeks pregnant when she won the Australian Open earlier that year.)</p><p id="nbgmqoudgga">Williams’s Instagram followers were, for the most part, enchanted. But soon, the enthusiastic congratulations were superseded by a very different conversation. A number of her followers—many of them Black women like Williams herself—fixated on the comment she’d made as she was heading home from the hospital with her baby girl. Those “complications” that Williams experienced—other women had had them too. In Williams’s case, the complications had been life-threatening, and her self-advocacy in the hospital played a major role in her survival.</p><p id="n7f5803qv86">On Williams’s Instagram feed, dozens of women began posting their own experiences of childbirth gone horribly wrong. A few months later, Williams returned to social media—Facebook, this time—to continue the conversation (figure 1.1). Citing a 2017 statement from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Williams wrote that “Black women are over 3 times more likely than white women to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes.”<a href="#fn-1-bottom" id="fn-1-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See Serena Williams, Facebook, January 15, 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/SerenaWilliams/videos/10156086135726834/&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/SerenaWilliams/videos/10156086135726834/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">2</a></p><p id="nink6wtom8u">These disparities were already well-known to Black-women-led reproductive justice groups like SisterSong, the Black Mamas Matter Alliance, and Raising Our Sisters Everywhere (ROSE), some of whom had been working on the maternal health crisis for decades. Williams helped to shine a national spotlight on them. The mainstream media also recently had begun to pay more attention to the crisis as well. A few months earlier, Nina Martin of the investigative journalism outfit ProPublica, working with Renee Montagne of NPR, had reported on the same phenomenon.<a href="#fn-2-bottom" id="fn-2-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Nina Martin and Renee Montagne, “Nothing Protects Black Women from Dying in Pregnancy and Childbirth,” ProPublica, December 7, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/nothing-protects-black-women-from-dying-in-pregnancy-and-childbirth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">3</a> “Nothing Protects Black Women from Dying in Pregnancy and Childbirth,” the headline read. In addition to the study cited by Williams, Martin and Montagne cited a second study from 2016, which showed that neither education nor income level—the factors usually invoked when attempting to account for healthcare outcomes that diverge along racial lines—impacted the fates of Black women giving birth.<a href="#fn-3-bottom" id="fn-3-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, &lt;em&gt;Severe Maternal Morbidity in New York City, 2008–2012&lt;/em&gt; (New York, 2016), &lt;a href=&quot;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/data/maternal-morbidity-report-08-12.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">4</a> On the contrary, the data showed that Black women with college degrees suffered more severe complications of pregnancy and childbirth than white women without high school diplomas.</p><figure id="n19q1odfuzn" data-node-type="image" data-size="85" data-align="center" data-url="https://assets.pubpub.org/zwsw1rrk/21583887685883.jpg" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.1: A Facebook post by Serena Williams responding to her Instagram followers who had shared their stories of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications with her.

“I didn’t expect that sharing our family’s story of Olympia’s birth and all of complications after giving birth would start such an outpouring of discussion from women — especially black women — who have faced similar complications and women whose problems go unaddressed. 

These aren’t just stories: according to the CDC, (Center for Disease Control) black women are over 3 times more likely than White women to die from pregnancy- or childbirth-related causes. We have a lot of work to do as a nation and I hope my story can inspire a conversation that gets us to close this gap.

Let me be clear: EVERY mother, regardless of race, or background deserves to have a healthy pregnancy and childbirth. I personally want all women of all colors to have the best experience they can have. My personal experience was not great but it was MY experience and I&#x27;m happy it happened to me. It made me stronger and it made me appreciate women -- both women with and without kids -- even more. We are powerful!!! 

I want to thank all of you who have opened up through online comments and other platforms to tell your story. I encourage you to continue to tell those stories. This helps. We can help others.

And how many women had actually died as a result? Nobody was counting. A 2014 United Nations report, coauthored by SisterSong, described the state of data collection on maternal mortality in the United States as “particularly weak.”<a href="#fn-4-bottom" id="fn-4-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;SisterSong, National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, and Center for Reproductive Rights, &lt;em&gt;Reproductive Injustice: Racial and Gender Discrimination in U.S. Health Care&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Center for Reproductive Rights, 2014), &lt;a href=&quot;https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CERD_NGO_USA_17560_E.pdf&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://tbinternet.ohchr.org/Treaties/CERD/Shared%20Documents/USA/INT_CERD_NGO_USA_17560_E.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">5</a> The situation hadn’t improved in 2017, when ProPublica began its reporting. In 2018, <em>USA Today</em> investigated these racial disparities, and found what was an even more fundamental problem: there was still no national system for tracking complications sustained in pregnancy and childbirth, even though similar systems had long been in place for tracking any number of other health issues, such as teen pregnancy, hip replacements, or heart attacks.<a href="#fn-5-bottom" id="fn-5-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;’s ongoing reporting on maternal mortality can be found at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usatoday.com/series/deadlydeliveries/&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.usatoday.com/series/deadlydeliveries/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">6</a> They also found that there was still no reporting mechanism for ensuring that hospitals follow national safety standards, as is required for both hip surgery and cardiac care. “Our maternal data is embarrassing,” stated Stacie Geller, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Illinois, when asked for comment. The chief of the CDC’s Maternal and Infant Health branch, William Callaghan, makes the significance of this “embarrassing” data more clear: “What we choose to measure is a statement of what we value in health,” he explains.<a href="#fn-6-bottom" id="fn-6-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Robin Fields and Joe Sexton, “How Many American Women Die from Causes Related to Pregnancy or Childbirth? No One Knows,” ProPublica, October 23, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-many-american-women-die-from-causes-related-to-pregnancy-or-childbirth&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-many-american-women-die-from-causes-related-to-pregnancy-or-childbirth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">7</a> We might edit his statement to add that it’s a measure of <em>who</em> we value in health, too.<a href="#fn-7-bottom" id="fn-7-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;In studies that try to infer maternal mortality through other indicators, like hospital records, what has been consistently shown is that the United States is one of the only countries in the world where maternal morbidity is increasing for all races, and increasing even more steeply for Black and brown women. For example, between 2000 and 2014, the CDC reported a 26.6 percent increase in the maternal mortality ratio in the United States. A 2018 report, &lt;em&gt;Trends and Disparities in Delivery Hospitalizations Involving Severe Maternal Morbidity, 2006–2015&lt;/em&gt;, showed that life-threatening complications increased for all races and ethnicities during that time. In 2015, dying in the hospital was three times more likely for Black mothers than for white mothers. There was no change in the disparity between white mothers and Black mothers during the period that the data covered.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">8</a></p><p id="n0l9k01zc88">Why did it take the near-death of an international sports superstar for the media to begin paying attention to an issue that less famous Black women had been experiencing and organizing around for decades? Why did it take reporting by the predominantly white mainstream press for US cities and states to begin collecting data on the issue?<a href="#fn-8-bottom" id="fn-8-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;According to the 2018 Newspaper Diversity Survey led by researcher Meredith Clarke for the American Society of News Editors, ProPublica’s leadership is 89 percent white, with no Black people in leadership positions, and &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;’s leadership is 85 percent white.

It’s absolutely not fair. So how do we mitigate this unfairness? We begin by examining systems of power and how they intersect—like how the influences of racism, sexism, and celebrity came together first to send Williams into a medical crisis and then, thankfully, to keep her alive. The complexity of these intersections is the reason that <em>examine power</em> is the first principle of data feminism, and the focus of this chapter. Examining power means naming and explaining the forces of oppression that are so baked into our daily lives—and into our datasets, our databases, and our algorithms—that we often don’t even see them. Seeing oppression is especially hard for those of us who occupy positions of privilege. But once we identify these forces and begin to understand how they exert their potent force, then many of the additional principles of data feminism—like challenging power (chapter 2), embracing emotion (chapter 3), and making labor visible (chapter 7)—become easier to undertake.</p><h2 id="power-and-the-matrix-of-domination">Power and the Matrix of Domination</h2><p id="nee7j4atmjm">But first, what do we mean by <em>power</em>? We use the term <em>power</em> to describe the current configuration of structural privilege and structural oppression, in which some groups experience unearned advantages—because various systems have been designed by people like them and work for people them—and other groups experience systematic disadvantages—because those same systems were not designed by them or with people like them in mind. These mechanisms are complicated, and there are “few pure victims and oppressors,” notes influential sociologist Patricia Hill Collins. In her landmark text, <em>Black Feminist Thought</em>, first published in 1990, Collins proposes the concept of the <em>matrix of domination</em> to explain how systems of power are configured and experienced.<a href="#fn-12-bottom" id="fn-12-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Patricia Hill Collins, &lt;em&gt;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Routledge, 2008), 21.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">13</a> It consists of four domains: the structural, the disciplinary, the hegemonic, and the interpersonal. Her emphasis is on the intersection of gender and race, but she makes clear that other dimensions of identity (sexuality, geography, ability, etc.) also result in unjust oppression, or unearned privilege, that become apparent across the same four domains.</p><p id="nn6fq2gj2xv">The <em>structural domain</em> is the arena of laws and policies, along with schools and institutions that implement them. This domain organizes and codifies oppression. Take, for example, the history of voting rights in the United States. The US Constitution did not originally specify who was authorized to vote, so various states had different policies that reflected their local politics. Most had to do with owning property, which, conveniently, only men could do. But with the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, which granted the rights of US citizenship to those who had been enslaved, the nature of those rights—including voting—were required to be spelled out at the national level for the first time. More specifically, voting was defined as a right reserved for “male citizens.” This is a clear instance of codified oppression in the structural domain.</p><p id="nv2s5ws6oo0"><br/></p><table id="nkiyehtj87r"><tbody><tr><th colSpan="2"><p id="nyev1rkcdpr"><strong>Table 1.1: The four domains of the matrix of domination</strong><a href="#fn-13-bottom" id="fn-13-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Chart based on concepts introduced by Patricia Hill Collins in &lt;em&gt;Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">14</a></p></th></tr><tr><td><p id="nhlmwq7fv16"><strong>Structural domain</strong></p><p id="nhi8mpw5wn1">Organizes oppression: laws and policies.</p></td><td><p id="nqjv05vvt9z"><strong>Disciplinary domain</strong></p><p id="ne8tfy1xgsb">Administers and manages oppression.

The Fourteenth Amendment explicitly excluded Native Americans from US citizenship—another instance of oppression being codified in the structural domain of the matrix of domination. In 1924, the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act granted joint US citizenship to all Native Americans, clearing the path for enfranchisement. But it would take until 1962 for the last US state (New Mexico) to change its laws so that all Native Americans could vote. Even then, obstacles abounded; the 1965 Voting Rights Act offered additional legal language to contest disenfranchisement, but that act is in the process of being dismantled by the Supreme Court (as of 2013, with &lt;em&gt;Shelby County v. Holder&lt;/em&gt;), which threatens many of its protections. On the subject of voting rights in the United States, it’s also worth pointing out that Puerto Rico did not have universal suffrage until 1935, and like other US territories, still does not have voting power in the US Congress or representation in the electoral college.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">15</a> Even still, many state voting laws continued to include literacy tests, residency requirements, and other ways to indirectly exclude people who were not property-owning white men. These restrictions persist today, in the form of practices like dropping names from voter rolls, requiring photo IDs, and limits to early voting—the burdens of which are felt disproportionately by low-income people, people of color, and others who lack the time or resources to jump through these additional bureaucratic hoops.<a href="#fn-15-bottom" id="fn-15-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Other disenfranchisement methods devised over the years have included undue wait times for registering to vote, having to pay a tax to vote, or having to take a test about the Constitution. Well through the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Black and brown people seeking to vote faced threats of bodily harm. Note that the history of voter suppression perpetrated by white people on people of color is not over. One need only consider the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, in which Brian Kemp, secretary of state and a white man, presided over his own gubernatorial race against Stacey Abrams, a Black woman. In his capacity as secretary of state, his actions included purging voter rolls and putting fifty-three thousand voter registrations on hold, 70 percent of which were for voters of color. Long lines and technical problems plagued the election day efforts, and the NAACP and ACLU sued the state of Georgia for voting irregularities. In short, voter suppression—enacted in the disciplinary domain of the matrix of domination—is alive and well. See German Lopez, “Voter Suppression Really May Have Made the Difference for Republicans in Georgia,” Vox, November 7, 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">16</a> This is the <em>disciplinary domain</em> that Collins names: the domain that administers and manages oppression through bureaucracy and hierarchy, rather than through laws that explicitly encode inequality on the basis of someone’s identity.<a href="#fn-16-bottom" id="fn-16-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Note that the disciplinary domain does not just have to do with government power and policy, but also with corporate, private, and institutional policies. A particular company prohibiting its workers from leaving early to vote or penalizing those who distribute information about voting on the factory floor is an example of the disciplinary domain.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">17</a></p><p id="na96i1d7r64">Neither of these domains would be possible without <em>the hegemonic domain</em>, which deals with the realm of culture, media, and ideas. Discriminatory policies and practices in voting can only be enacted in a world that already circulates oppressive ideas about, for example, who counts as a citizen in the first place. Consider an anti-suffragist pamphlet from the 1910s that proclaims, “You do not need a ballot to clean out your sink spout.”<a href="#fn-17-bottom" id="fn-17-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Eleanor Barkhorn, “‘Vote No on Women’s Suffrage’: Bizarre Reasons for Not Letting Women Vote,” &lt;em&gt;Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, November 6, 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/vote-no-on-womens-suffrage-bizarre-reasons-for-not-letting-women-vote/264639/&quot;&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2012/11/vote-no-on-womens-suffrage-bizarre-reasons-for-not-letting-women-vote/264639/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">18</a> Pamphlets like these, designed to be literally passed from hand to hand, reinforced preexisting societal views about the place of women in society. Today, we have animated GIFs instead of paper pamphlets, but the hegemonic function is the same: to consolidate ideas about who is entitled to exercise power and who is not.</p><p id="n24vcbzl124">The final part of the matrix of domination is the <em>interpersonal domain</em>, which influences the everyday experience of individuals in the world. How would you feel if you were a woman who read that pamphlet, for example? Would it have more or less of an impact if a male family member gave it to you? Or, for a more recent example, how would you feel if you took time off from your hourly job to go cast your vote, only to discover when you got there that your name had been purged from the official voting roll or that there was a line so long that it would require that you miss half a day’s pay, or stand for hours in the cold, or ... the list could go on. These are examples of how it <em>feels</em> to know that systems of power are not on your side and, at times, are actively seeking to take away the small amount of power that you do possess.<a href="#fn-18-bottom" id="fn-18-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;This is a point that Collins underscores: “Oppression is not simply understood in the mind—it is felt in the body in myriad ways,” she writes (&lt;em&gt;Black Feminist Thought&lt;/em&gt;, 293).&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">19</a></p><p id="najzkp03wa6">The matrix of domination works to uphold the undue privilege of <em>dominant</em> groups while unfairly oppressing <em>minoritized</em> groups. What does this mean? Beginning in this chapter and continuing throughout the book, we use the term <em>minoritized</em> to describe groups of people who are positioned in opposition to a more powerful social group. While the term <em>minority</em> describes a social group that is comprised of fewer people, <em>minoritized</em> indicates that a social group is actively devalued and oppressed by a dominant group, one that holds more economic, social, and political power. With respect to gender, for example, men constitute the dominant group, while all other genders constitute minoritized groups. This remains true even as women actually constitute a majority of the world population. <em>Sexism</em> is the term that names this form of oppression. In relation to race, white people constitute the dominant group (racism); in relation to class, wealthy and educated people constitute the dominant group (classism); and so on.<a href="#fn-19-bottom" id="fn-19-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;For further explanation of why &lt;em&gt;minoritized&lt;/em&gt; makes more sense to use than &lt;em&gt;minority&lt;/em&gt;, see I.

This often means asking uncomfortable questions: who is doing the work of data science (and who is not)? Whose goals are prioritized in data science (and whose are not)? And who benefits from data science (and who is either overlooked or actively harmed)?<a href="#fn-20-bottom" id="fn-20-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;This role often entails what Sara Ahmed has described as being a “feminist killjoy.” As she writes in the first post on her blog, you might be a feminist killjoy if you “have ruined the atmosphere by turning up or speaking up” or “have a body that reminds people of histories they find disturbing” or “are angry because that’s a sensible response to what is wrong.” The feminist killjoy exposes racism and sexism, but “for those who do not have a sense of the racism or sexism you are talking about, to bring them up is to bring them into existence.” In the process of exposing the problem, the feminist killjoy herself becomes a problem. She is “causing trouble” or getting in the way of the happiness of others by bringing up the issue. For example, a personal killjoy moment from the book-writing process happened when Catherine shared the topic of the book with a former professor, who responded that she should stay focused on data literacy and not become one of those “grumpy feminists” who were uncomfortable with their sexuality and sought to make problems for people. For the record, Catherine is not grumpy, feels confident in her sexuality, and is working on the killjoy skills of making more feminist problems for people.

For comparison, 26% women graduates today is the same percentage of women computer science graduates in 1974, and in subfields like machine learning, the proportion of women is far less. As per the points made in this chapter, even knowing the exact extent of the disparity is challenging. According to a 2014 &lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; report about diversity in Silicon Valley, tech firms convinced the US Labor Department to treat their demographics as a trade secret and didn’t divulge any data until after they were sued by Mike Swift of the &lt;em&gt;San Jose Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;.

The same report noted specific underrepresentation for Native American women, multiracial women, white women, and all Black and Latinx people. So is it really a surprise that each day brings a new example of data science being used to disempower and oppress minoritized groups? In 2018, it was revealed that Amazon had been developing an algorithm to screen its first-round job applicants. But because the model had been trained on the resumes of prior applicants, who were predominantly male, it developed an even stronger preference for male applicants. It downgraded resumes with the word <em>women</em> and graduates of women’s colleges. Ultimately, Amazon had to cancel the project.<a href="#fn-27-bottom" id="fn-27-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;In the case of a different resume screening tool (not the one developed by Amazon), it was found that the most predictive factors of job performance success were whether someone was named “Jared” and if they had played lacrosse. We might laugh at the absurdity of such random and specific details, but note how they tell us a lot about the group characteristics of who is getting hired: Jared is a mostly men’s name, a mostly white name, and lacrosse—in spite of its Native American origins—is an expensive and predominantly elite, white sport.

Noble describes how, as recently as 2016, comparable searches for “three Black teenagers” and “three white teenagers” turned up wildly different representations of those teens. The former returned mugshots, while the latter returned wholesome stock photography.<a href="#fn-28-bottom" id="fn-28-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Safiya Umoja Noble, &lt;em&gt;Algorithms of Oppression: How Search Engines Reinforce Racism&lt;/em&gt; (New York: NYU Press, 2018), 80–81.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">29</a></p><p id="nyufk8vg3nv">The problems of gender and racial bias in our information systems are complex, but some of their key causes are plain as day: the data that shape them, and the models designed to put those data to use, are created by small groups of people and then scaled up to users around the globe. But those small groups are not at all representative of the globe as a whole, nor even of a single city in the United States. When data teams are primarily composed of people from dominant groups, those perspectives come to exert outsized influence on the decisions being made—to the exclusion of other identities and perspectives. This is not usually intentional; it comes from the ignorance of being on top. We describe this deficiency as a <em>privilege hazard</em>.</p><p id="nl76rzgwa6k">How does this come to pass? Let’s take a minute to imagine what life is like for someone who epitomizes the dominant group in data science: a straight, white, cisgender man with formal technical credentials who lives in the United States. When he looks for a home or applies for a credit card, people are eager for his business. People smile when he holds his girlfriend’s hand in public. His body doesn’t change due to childbirth or breastfeeding, so he does not need to think about workplace accommodations. He presents his social security number in jobs as a formality, but it never hinders his application from being processed or brings him unwanted attention. The ease with which he traverses the world is invisible to him because it has been designed for people just like him. He does not think about how life might be different for everyone else. In fact, it is difficult for him to imagine that at all.</p><p id="n68d1uwqne9">This is the <em>privilege hazard</em>: the phenomenon that makes those who occupy the most privileged positions among us—those with good educations, respected credentials, and professional accolades—so poorly equipped to recognize instances of oppression in the world.<a href="#fn-29-bottom" id="fn-29-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Feminist legal scholar Martha R. Mahoney summarizes the effect of this privilege hazard with respect to race: “A crucial part of the privilege of a dominant group is the ability to see itself as normal and neutral. This quality of being ‘normal’ makes whiteness and the racial specificity of our own lives invisible as air to white people, while it is visible or offensively obvious to people defined outside the circle of whiteness.” The passage appears in “Whiteness and Women, In Practice and Theory: A Response to Catherine McKinnon,” &lt;em&gt;Yale Journal of Law &amp;amp; Feminism&lt;/em&gt; 5, no. 2 (1993): 217–251.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">30</a> They lack what Anita Gurumurthy, executive director of IT for Change, has called “the empiricism of lived experience.”<a href="#fn-30-bottom" id="fn-30-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;From Anita Gurumurthy’s keynote address at Data Justice 2018, Cardiff University.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">31</a> And this lack of lived experience—this evidence of how things truly <em>are</em>—profoundly limits their ability to foresee and prevent harm, to identify existing problems in the world, and to imagine possible solutions.</p><p id="n3dnmi0b02a">The privilege hazard occurs at the level of the individual—in the interpersonal domain of the matrix of domination—but it is much more harmful in aggregate because it reaches the hegemonic, disciplinary and structural domains as well. So it matters deeply that data science and artificial intelligence are dominated by elite white men because it means there is a collective privilege hazard so great that it would be a profound surprise if they could actually identify instances of bias prior to unleashing them onto the world. Social scientist Kate Crawford has advanced the idea that the biggest threat from artificial intelligence systems is not that they will become smarter than humans, but rather that they will hard-code sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination into the digital infrastructure of our societies.<a href="#fn-31-bottom" id="fn-31-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Kate Crawford, “Artificial Intelligence’s White Guy Problem,” &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, June 26, 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/26/opinion/sunday/artificial-intelligences-white-guy-problem.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">32</a></p><p id="npwrugd3uxr">What’s more, the same cis het white men responsible for designing those systems lack the ability to detect harms and biases in their systems once they’ve been released into the world.<a href="#fn-32-bottom" id="fn-32-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cis het&lt;/em&gt; is shorthand for &lt;em&gt;cisgender heterosexual&lt;/em&gt;.

The burden consistently falls upon those more intimately familiar with the privilege hazard—in data science as in life—to call out the creators of those systems for their limitations.</p><p id="nd6lllmzofs">For example, Joy Buolamwini, a Ghanaian-American graduate student at MIT, was working on a class project using facial-analysis software.<a href="#fn-33-bottom" id="fn-33-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Facial analysis software is used to detect faces in a larger image, such as when some digital cameras create outlines around any faces that they detect in a frame.

It had no problem seeing her lighter-skinned collaborators. She tried drawing a face on her hand and putting it in front of the camera; it detected that. Finally, Buolamwini put on a white mask, essentially going in “whiteface” (figure 1.3).<a href="#fn-34-bottom" id="fn-34-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackface&lt;/em&gt; refers to the racist practice of predominantly non-Black performers painting their faces to signal their caricatured representation of Black people. The tradition has a long history, and has directly contributed to the spread of racist stereotypes about Black people. On its history, see Eric Lott, &lt;em&gt;Love and Theft: Blackface Minstrelsy and the American Working Class&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993). On some contemporary manifestations, see Lauren Michele Jackson, “We Need to Talk about Digital Blackface in Reaction GIFs,” &lt;em&gt;Teen Vogue&lt;/em&gt;, August 2, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/digital-blackface-reaction-gifs&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.teenvogue.com/story/digital-blackface-reaction-gifs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">35</a> The system detected the mask’s facial features perfectly.</p><p id="niwkkcwxjpn">Digging deeper into the code and benchmarking data behind these systems, Buolamwini discovered that the dataset on which many of facial-recognition algorithms are tested contains 78 percent male faces and 84 percent white faces. When she did an intersectional breakdown of another test dataset—looking at gender and skin type together—only 4 percent of the faces in that dataset were women and dark-skinned. In their evaluation of three commercial systems, Buolamwini and computer scientist Timnit Gebru showed that darker-skinned women were up to forty-four times more likely to be misclassified than lighter-skinned males.<a href="#fn-35-bottom" id="fn-35-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See Joy Buolamwini and Timnit Gebru, “Gender Shades: Intersectional Accuracy Disparities in Commercial Gender Classification,” &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of Machine Learning Research&lt;/em&gt; 81 (2018): 1–15, http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">36</a> It’s no wonder that the software failed to detect Buolamwini’s face: both the training data and the benchmarking data relegate women of color to a tiny fraction of the overall dataset.<a href="#fn-36-bottom" id="fn-36-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Training automated systems involves using &lt;em&gt;training data&lt;/em&gt; to teach the model how to classify things. For example, in the case of Buolamwini’s work, the training data would consist of images with and without faces, and the model would be trained to detect whether or not there is a face in each image and, if so, to identify the specific location of the face. Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using another dataset—called a &lt;em&gt;test dataset&lt;/em&gt;—to determine whether the model works only on the training data or whether it is likely to perform well with new data. Finally, once the model has been tested, it is evaluated again with what’s called a &lt;em&gt;benchmarking dataset&lt;/em&gt;. Benchmarking data consists of an agreed upon standard dataset that makes possible to compare different models—so a researcher could say something like, “The facial detection model from X university performed at 90 percent accuracy, whereas the model from Y corporation performed at 87 percent accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">37</a></p><figure id="nhxv79s2hq8" data-node-type="image" data-size="50" data-align="full" data-url="https://assets.pubpub.org/mp1fcupn/01583887685885.jpg" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.3: Joy Buolamwini found that she had to put on a white mask for the facial detection program to “see” her face.

(They need to read data journalist Meredith Broussard’s book <em>Artificial Unintelligence</em>).<a href="#fn-38-bottom" id="fn-38-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Artificial Unintelligence&lt;/em&gt; (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2018), data journalist and professor Meredith Broussard outlines the concept of technochauvinism: the belief that the technological solution to a problem is the right one.

We can speculate that Darden herself wasn’t shocked, just as Buolamwini and Gebru likely were not entirely shocked at the outcome of their study either. When sexism, racism, and other forms of oppression are publicly unmasked, it is almost never surprising to those who experience them.</p><p id="ny3o8e4wm9p">For people in positions of power and privilege, issues of race and gender and class and ability—to name only a few—are OPP: other people’s problems. Author and antiracist educator Robin DiAngelo describes instances like the “shock” of Darden’s boss or the surprise in the media coverage of Buolamwini’s various projects as a symptom of the “racial innocence” of white people.<a href="#fn-39-bottom" id="fn-39-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;In her book &lt;em&gt;White Fragility&lt;/em&gt;, DiAngelo goes further, demonstrating how racial innocence can be viewed as a deliberate social strategy for maintaining power and dominance in society.

See &lt;em&gt;White Fragility: Why It’s So Hard for White People to Talk about Racism&lt;/em&gt; (London: Penguin Books, 2019); and &lt;em&gt;Racial Innocence: Performing American Childhood from Slavery to Civil Rights&lt;/em&gt; (New York: NYU Press, 2011).&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">40</a> In other words, those who occupy positions of privilege in society are able to remain innocent of that privilege. Race becomes something that only people of color have. Gender becomes something that only women and nonbinary people have. Sexual orientation becomes something that all people <em>except</em> heterosexual people have. And so on. A personal anecdote might help illustrate this point. When we published the first draft of this book online, Catherine told a colleague about it. His earnestly enthusiastic response was, “Oh great! I’ll show it to my female graduate students!” To which Catherine rejoined, “You might want to show it to your other students, too.”</p><p id="nqxtn8vwkrm">If things were different—if the 79 percent of engineers at Google who are male were specifically trained in structural oppression before building their data systems (as social workers are before they undertake social work)—then their overrepresentation might be very slightly less of a problem.<a href="#fn-40-bottom" id="fn-40-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Danielle Brown, “Google Diversity Annual Report 2018,” Google, 2018, accessed April 10, 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//static/pdf/Google_Diversity_annual_report_2018.pdf&quot;&gt;https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//static/pdf/Google_Diversity_annual_report_2018.pdf&lt;/a&gt;; and Catherine D’Ignazio, “How Might Ethical Data Principles Borrow from Social Work?,” Medium, September 2, 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@kanarinka/how-might-ethical-data-principles-borrow-from-social-work-3162f08f0353&quot;&gt;https://medium.com/@kanarinka/how-might-ethical-data-principles-borrow-from-social-work-3162f08f0353&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">41</a> But in the meantime, the onus falls on the individuals who already feel the adverse effects of those systems of power to prove, over and over again, that racism and sexism exist—in datasets, in data systems, and in data science, as in everywhere else.</p><p id="nj8gkc09oux">Buolamwini and Gebru identified how pale and male faces were overrepresented in facial detection training data. Could we just fix this problem by diversifying the data set? One solution to the problem would appear to be straightforward: create a more representative set of training and benchmarking data for facial detection models. In fact, tech companies are starting to do exactly this.

More often than not, it is enlisted in the service of increased oppression, greater surveillance, and targeted violence. Buolamwini understands these potential harms and has developed an approach that works across all four domains of the matrix of domination to address the underlying issues of power that are playing out in facial analysis technology. Buolamwini and Gebru first quantified the disparities in the dataset—a technical audit, which falls in the disciplinary domain of the matrix of domination. Then, Buolamwini went on to launch the Algorithmic Justice League, an organization that works to highlight and intervene in instances of algorithmic bias. On behalf of the AJL, Buolamwini has produced viral poetry projects and given TED talks—taking action in the hegemonic domain, the realm of culture and ideas.

In early 2019, the AJL collaborated with the Center on Technology &amp;amp; Privacy at Georgetown Law to launch the Safe Face Pledge, a set of four ethical commitments that businesses and governments make when using facial analysis technology. Many AI companies and prominent researchers have signed the Safe Face Pledge at the time of this writing. Notably, Amazon, which sells its Rekognition technology to police departments around the country, has not signed and has actively attacked Buolamwini’s research.

Mimi Onuoha—an artist, designer, and educator—has long been asking <em>who questions</em> about data science. Her project, <em>The Library of Missing Datasets</em> (figure 1.4), is a list of datasets that one might expect to already exist in the world, because they help to address pressing social issues, but that in reality have never been created. The project exists as a website and as an art object. The latter consists of a file cabinet filled with folders labeled with phrases like: “People excluded from public housing because of criminal records,” “Mobility for older adults with physical disabilities or cognitive impairments,” and “Total number of local and state police departments using stingray phone trackers (IMSI-catchers).” Visitors can tab through the folders and remove any particular folder of interest, only to reveal that it is empty.

And by calling attention to these datasets as “missing,” she also calls attention to how the matrix of domination encodes these “social biases and indifferences” across all levels of society.<a href="#fn-48-bottom" id="fn-48-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Mimi Onuoha, “On Missing Data Sets,” GitHub, January 25, 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://github.com/MimiOnuoha/missing-datasets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">49</a> Along similar lines, foundations like Data2X and books like <em>Invisible Women</em> have advanced the idea of a systematic “gender data gap” due to the fact that the majority of research data in scientific studies is based around men’s bodies. The downstream effects of the gender data gap range from annoying—cell phones slightly too large for women’s hands, for example—to fatal. Until recently, crash test dummies were designed in the size and shape of men, an oversight that meant that women had a 47 percent higher chance of car injury than men.<a href="#fn-49-bottom" id="fn-49-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Mayra Buvinic, Rebecca Furst-Nichols and Gayatri Koolwal, &lt;em&gt;Mapping Gender Data Gaps&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Data2X, 2014), &lt;a href=&quot;https://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Data2X_MappingGenderDataGaps_FullReport.pdf&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://data2x.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Data2X_MappingGenderDataGaps_FullReport.pdf&lt;/a&gt;; and Caroline Criado Perez, &lt;em&gt;Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Random House, 2019).&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">50</a></p><p id="nrr89f8qxoe">The <em>who</em> <em>question</em> in this case is: Who benefits from data science and who is overlooked?

Her goal was to situate the murders of women in a context of unequal gender relations. In this context, men use violence to systematically dominate and exert power over women. And the research bears this out. While male victims of homicide are more likely to have been killed by strangers, a 2009 report published by the World Health Organization and partners notes a “universal finding in all regions” that women are far more likely to have been murdered by someone they know. Femicide includes a range of gender-related crimes, including intimate and interpersonal violence, political violence, gang activity, and female infanticide. Such deaths are often depicted as isolated incidents and treated as such by authorities, but those who study femicides characterize them as a pattern of underrecognized and underaddressed systemic violence. See World Health Organization, &lt;em&gt;Strengthening Understanding of Femicide: Using Research to Galvanize Action and Accountability&lt;/em&gt; (Washington, DC: Program for Appropriate Technology in Health [PATH], InterCambios, Medical Research Council of South Africa [MRC], and World Health Organization [WHO], 2009), 110.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">57</a> María Salguero, who also goes by the name Princesa, has logged more than five thousand cases of femicide since 2016.<a href="#fn-57-bottom" id="fn-57-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See Maria Salguero’s map at &lt;a href=&quot;https://feminicidiosmx.crowdmap.com/&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://feminicidiosmx.crowdmap.com/&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=174IjBzP-fl_6wpRHg5pkGSj2egE&amp;amp;ll=23.942983359872816%2C-101.9008685&amp;amp;z=5&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=174IjBzP-fl_6wpRHg5pkGSj2egE&amp;amp;ll=23.942983359872816%2C-101.9008685&amp;amp;z=5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">58</a> Her work provides the most accessible information on the subject for journalists, activists, and victims’ families seeking justice.</p><p id="nqw3ximj744">The issue of femicide in Mexico rose to global visibility in the mid-2000s with widespread media coverage about the deaths of poor and working-class women in Ciudad Juárez. A border town, Juárez is the site of more than three hundred <em>maquiladoras</em>: factories that employ women to assemble goods and electronics, often for low wages and in substandard working conditions. Between 1993 and 2005, nearly four hundred of these women were murdered, with around a third of those murders exhibiting signs of exceptional brutality or sexual violence. Convictions were made in only three of those deaths. In response, a number of activist groups like Ni Una Más (Not One More) and Nuestras Hijas de Regreso a Casa (Our Daughters Back Home) were formed, largely motivated by mothers demanding justice for their daughters, often at great personal risk to themselves.<a href="#fn-58-bottom" id="fn-58-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Marisela Escobedo Ortiz, the mother of one such victim, was herself shot at point-blank range and killed while demonstrating in front of the Governor’s Palace in Chihuahua in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">59</a></p><p id="nyhjpmfl2kx">These groups succeeded in gaining the attention of the Mexican government, which established a Special Commission on Femicide. But despite the commission and the fourteen volumes of information about femicide that it produced, and despite a 2009 ruling against the Mexican state by the Inter-American Human Rights Court, and despite a United Nations Symposium on Femicide in 2012, and despite the fact that sixteen Latin American countries have now passed laws defining femicide—despite all of this, deaths in Juárez have continued to rise.<a href="#fn-59-bottom" id="fn-59-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;The toll now stands at more than 1,500.

As is true in so many cases of data collected (or not) about women and other minoritized groups, the collection environment is compromised by imbalances of power.</p><p id="n1v6tc0nk3h">The most grave and urgent manifestation of the matrix of domination is within the interpersonal domain, in which cis and trans women become the victims of violence and murder at the hands of men. Although law and policy (the structural domain) have recognized the crime of femicide, no specific policies have been implemented to ensure adequate information collection, either by federal agencies or local authorities. Thus the disciplinary domain, in which law and policy are enacted, is characterized by a deferral of responsibility, a failure to investigate, and victim blaming. This persists in a somewhat recursive fashion because there are no consequences imposed within the structural domain. For example, the Special Commission’s definition of femicide as a “crime of the state” speaks volumes to how the government of Mexico is deeply complicit through inattention and indifference.<a href="#fn-61-bottom" id="fn-61-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;After three years of investigating, the commission, chaired by politician Marcela Lagarde, found that femicide was indeed occurring and that the Mexican government was systematically failing to protect women and girls from being killed. Lagarde suggested that femicide be considered, “a crime of the state which tolerates the murders of women and neither vigorously investigates the crimes nor holds the killers accountable.” See World Health Organization, &lt;em&gt;Strengthening Understanding of Femicide&lt;/em&gt;, 11.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">62</a></p><p id="n4jqnrjj99z">Of course, this inaction would not have been tolerated without the assistance of the hegemonic domain—the realm of media and culture—which presents men as strong and women as subservient, men as public and women as private, trans people as deviating from “essential” norms, and nonbinary people as nonexistent altogether. Indeed, government agencies have used their public platforms to blame victims. Following the femicide of twenty-two-year-old Mexican student Lesvy Osorio in 2017, researcher Maria Rodriguez-Dominguez documented how the Public Prosecutor’s Office of Mexico City shared on social media that the victim was an alcoholic and drug user who had been living out of wedlock with her boyfriend.<a href="#fn-62-bottom" id="fn-62-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See Maria Rodriguez-Dominguez, “Femicide and Victim Blaming in Mexico, Council on Hemispheric Affairs, October 2, 2017, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.coha.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Maria-Rodriguez-Femicidio-Mexico-.pdf&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;http://www.coha.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Maria-Rodriguez-Femicidio-Mexico-.pdf&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">63</a> This led to justified public backlash, and to the hashtag #SiMeMatan (If they kill me), which prompted sarcastic tweets such as “#SiMeMatan it’s because I liked to go out at night and drink a lot of beer.”<a href="#fn-63-bottom" id="fn-63-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Mara Miranda (@MaraMiranda25), “#SiMeMatan es porque me gustaba salir de noche y tomar mucha cerveza ... ,” Twitter, May 5, 2017, 11:17 a.m., &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MaraMiranda25/status/860559096285720581&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/MaraMiranda25/status/860559096285720581&lt;/a&gt;.

Salguero manually plots a pin on the map for every femicide that she collects through media reports or through crowdsourced contributions (figure 1.5a). One of her goals is to “show that these victims [each] had a name and that they had a life,” and so Salguero logs as many details as she can about each death. These include name, age, relationship with the perpetrator, mode and place of death, and whether the victim was transgender, as well as the full content of the news report that served as the source. Figure 1.5b shows a detailed view for a single report from an unidentified transfemicide, including the date, time, location, and media article about the killing. It can take Salguero three to four hours a day to do this unpaid work. She takes occasional breaks to preserve her mental health, and she typically has a backlog of a month’s worth of femicides to add to the map.</p><p id="ngyemnd23l7">Although media reportage and crowdsourcing are imperfect ways of collecting data, this particular map, created and maintained by a single person, fills a vacuum created by her national government.

Salguero is not affiliated with an activist group, but she makes her data available to activist groups for their efforts. Parents of victims have called her to give their thanks for making their daughters visible, and Salguero affirms this function as well: “This map seeks to make visible the sites where they are killing us, to find patterns, to bolster arguments about the problem, to georeference aid, to promote prevention and try to avoid femicides.”</p><figure id="na671h33ms0" data-node-type="image" data-size="50" data-align="full" data-url="https://assets.pubpub.org/320pk5hi/21583887685888.jpeg" data-caption="" data-alt-text="A map of Mexico with colored markers to represent locations where femicides have occurred.

Juárez, Chih.- Un individuo que aparentemente pertenecía a la comunidad LGBT fue localizado sin vida por la noche en un fraccionamiento ubicado al sur oriente de la ciudad, reportaron las corporaciones policicas. 
El cuerpo del hombre vestido de mujer y en avanzado estado de descomposición fue encontrado en el fondo de un pozo de contención de aguas pluviales. 
El occiso tení una bolsa de plástico en la cabeza, aunque personal de la Fiscalí General del estado asegura no le pudieron encontrar huellas externas de violencia. 
Al lugar de los hechos llegaron sus familiares y lo identificaron como Hilario Lopez Ruiz, de quien no se proporcionó más información. 
El cuerpo fue enviado al Servicio Médico Forense donde se le practicara la autopsia de ley y determinar de esa manera las causas reales de su fallecimiento.

The phenomenon of missing data is a regular and expected outcome in all societies characterized by unequal power relations, in which a gendered, racialized order is maintained through willful disregard, deferral of responsibility, and organized neglect for data and statistics about those minoritized bodies who do not hold power. So too are examples of individuals and communities using strategies like Salguero’s to fill in the gaps left by these missing datasets—in the United States as around the world.<a href="#fn-64-bottom" id="fn-64-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Missing data is not a new problem; the fields of critical cartography and critical GIS have long considered the phenomenon of missing data. Contemporary examples of missing data and counterdata collection include “The Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Database,” created by doctoral student Annita Lucchesi, which tracks Indigenous women who are killed or disappear under suspicious circumstances in the United States and Canada (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sovereign-bodies.org/mmiw-database&quot;&gt;https://www.sovereign-bodies.org/mmiw-database&lt;/a&gt;). Jonathan Gray, Danny Lämmerhirt, and Liliana Bounegru also wrote a report which includes case studies of citizen involvement in collecting data on drones, police killings, water supplies, and pollution. See “Changing What Counts: How Can Citizen-Generated and Civil Society Data Be Used as an Advocacy Tool to Change Official Data Collection?,” 2016, &lt;a href=&quot;https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2742871&quot;&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2742871&lt;/a&gt;. Environmental health and justice is an area in which communities are out front collecting data when agencies refuse or neglect to do so. The MappingBack Network (&lt;a href=&quot;http://mappingback.org/home_en/aboutus/&quot;&gt;http://mappingback.org/home_en/aboutus/&lt;/a&gt;) provides mapping capacity and support to Indigenous communities fighting extractive industries, and Sara Wylie, cofounder of Public Lab, works with communities impacted by fracking to measure hydrogen sulfide using low-cost DIY sensors. See Sara Wylie, Elisabeth Wilder, Lourdes Vera, Deborah Thomas, and Megan McLaughlin, “Materializing Exposure: Developing an Indexical Method to Visualize Health Hazards Related to Fossil Fuel Extraction,” &lt;em&gt;Engaging Science, Technology, and Society&lt;/em&gt; 3 (2017): 426–463. Indigenous cartographers Margaret Wickens Pearce and Renee Pualani Louis describe cartographic techniques for recuperating Indigenous perspectives and epistemologies (often absent or misrepresented) into GIS maps. See Margaret Pearce and Renee Louis, “Mapping Indigenous Depth of Place,” &lt;em&gt;American Indian Culture and Research Journal&lt;/em&gt; 32, no. 3 (2008): 107–126. All that said, participatory data collection efforts have their own silences, as Heather Ford and Judy Wajcman show in their study of the “missing women” of Wikipedia: “‘Anyone Can Edit,’ Not Everyone Does: Wikipedia’s Infrastructure and the Gender Gap,” &lt;em&gt;Social Studies of Science&lt;/em&gt; 47, no. 4 (2017): 511–527.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">65</a> If “quantification is representation,” as data journalist Jonathan Stray asserts, then this offers one way to hold those in power accountable. Collecting counterdata demonstrates how data science can be enlisted on behalf of individuals and communities that need more power on their side.<a href="#fn-65-bottom" id="fn-65-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Stray, &lt;em&gt;The Curious Journalist’s Guide to Data&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Columbia Journalism School, 2016).&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">66</a></p><h2 id="data-science-with-whose-interests-and-goals">Data Science with Whose Interests and Goals?</h2><p id="nslg7o2jt8y">Far too often, the problem is not that data about minoritized groups are missing but the reverse: the databases and data systems of powerful institutions are built on the excessive surveillance of minoritized groups. This results in women, people of color, and poor people, among others, being overrepresented in the data that these systems are premised upon. In <em>Automating Inequality</em>, for example, Virginia Eubanks tells the story of the Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth, and Families in western Pennsylvania, which employs an algorithmic model to predict the risk of child abuse in any particular home.<a href="#fn-66-bottom" id="fn-66-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Virginia Eubanks, &lt;em&gt;Automating Inequality: How High-Tech Tools Profile, Police, and Punish the Poor&lt;/em&gt; (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2018).&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">67</a> The goal of the model is to remove children from potentially abusive households before it happens; this would appear to be a very worthy goal. As Eubanks shows, however, inequities result. For wealthier parents, who can more easily access private health care and mental health services, there is simply not that much data to pull into the model. For poor parents, who more often rely on public resources, the system scoops up records from child welfare services, drug and alcohol treatment programs, mental health services, Medicaid histories, and more. Because there are far more data about poor parents, they are oversampled in the model, and so their children are overtargeted as being at risk for child abuse—a risk that results in children being removed from their families and homes. Eubanks argues that the model “confuse[s] parenting while poor with poor parenting.”</p><p id="nc7e0kkwbnk">This model, like many, was designed under two flawed assumptions: (1) that more data is always better and (2) that the data are a neutral input. In practice, however, the reality is quite different. The higher proportion of poor parents in the database, with more complete data profiles, the more likely the model will be to find fault with poor parents. And data are never neutral; they are always the biased output of unequal social, historical, and economic conditions: this is the matrix of domination once again.<a href="#fn-67-bottom" id="fn-67-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;“The data are not neutral” is a recurring theme of data feminism. This doesn’t mean that data are never useful, just that they are never neutral representations of some sort of essential truth. Examining and understanding the asymmetries of power in the data collection environment (that lead to inequities in the dataset itself) is one of the key responsibilities of the feminist data scientist.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">68</a> Governments can and do use biased data to marshal the power of the matrix of domination in ways that amplify its effects on the least powerful in society. In this case, the model becomes a way to administer and manage classism in the disciplinary domain—with the consequence that poor parents’ attempts to access resources and improve their lives, when compiled as data, become the same data that remove their children from their care.</p><p id="nz1b4tiwswa">So this raises our next <em>who</em> <em>question</em>: Whose goals are prioritized in data science (and whose are not)? In this case, the state of Pennsylvania prioritized its bureaucratic goal of efficiency, which is an oft-cited reason for coming up with a technical solution to a social and political dilemma. Viewed from the perspective of the state, there were simply not enough employees to handle all of the potential child abuse cases, so it needed a mechanism for efficiently deploying limited staff—or so the reasoning goes. This is what Eubanks has described as a <em>scarcity bias</em>: the idea that there are not enough resources for everyone so we should think small and allow technology to fill the gaps. Such thinking, and the technological “solutions” that result, often meet the goals of their creators—in this case, the Allegheny County Office of Children, Youth, and Families—but not the goals of the children and families that it purports to serve.</p><p id="npbtvveoy9s">Corporations also place their own goals ahead of those of the people their products purport to serve, supported by their outsize wealth and the power that comes with it. For example, in 2012, the <em>New York Times</em> published an explosive article by Charles Duhigg, “How Companies Learn Your Secrets,”<a href="#fn-68-bottom" id="fn-68-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Charles Duhigg, “How Companies Learn Your Secrets,” &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, February 19, 2012.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">69</a> which soon became the stuff of legend in data and privacy circles. Duhigg describes how Andrew Pole, a data scientist working at Target, was approached by men from the marketing department who asked, “If we wanted to figure out if a customer is pregnant, even if she didn’t want us to know, can you do that?”<a href="#fn-69-bottom" id="fn-69-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Duhigg, “How Companies Learn Your Secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">70</a> He proceeded to synthesize customers’ purchasing histories with the timeline of those purchases to give each customer a so-called pregnancy prediction score (figure 1.6).<a href="#fn-70-bottom" id="fn-70-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;The Target “pregnancy prediction score” was more detection than actual prediction because by the time the products were purchased, the customer was likely already pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">71</a> Evidently, pregnancy is the second major life event, after leaving for college, that determines whether a casual shopper will become a customer for life.</p><p id="nxx1en6744v">Target turned around and put Pole’s pregnancy detection model into action in an automated system that sent discount coupons to possibly pregnant customers. Win-win—or so the company thought, until a Minneapolis teenager’s dad saw the coupons for baby clothes that she was getting in the mail and marched into his local Target to read the manager the riot act. Why was his daughter getting coupons for pregnant women when she was only a teen?!</p><p id="n69qjo5rvz8">It turned out that the young woman was indeed pregnant. Pole’s model informed Target before the teenager informed her family. By analyzing the purchase dates of approximately twenty-five common products, such as unscented lotion and large bags of cotton balls, the model found a set of purchase patterns that were highly correlated with pregnancy status and expected due date. But the win-win quickly became a lose-lose, as Target lost the trust of its customers in a PR disaster and the Minneapolis teenager lost far worse: her control over information related to her own body and her health.</p><figure id="ntx992vv170" data-node-type="image" data-size="50" data-align="full" data-url="https://assets.pubpub.org/c042vj3h/51583887685889.jpg" data-caption="&lt;p&gt;Figure 1.6: Screenshot from a video of statistician Andrew Pole’s presentation at Predictive Analytics World about Target’s pregnancy detection model in October 2010, titled “How Target Gets the Most out of Its Guest Data to Improve Marketing ROI.” He discusses the model at 47:50.

But it is not only a story about privacy: it is also a story about gender injustice—about how corporations approach data relating to women’s bodies and lives, and about how corporations approach data relating to minoritized populations more generally. Whose goals are prioritized in this case? The corporation’s, of course. For Target, the primary motivation was maximizing profit, and quarterly financial reports to the board are the measurement of success. Whose goals are <em>not</em> prioritized? The teenager’s and those of every other pregnant woman out there.</p><p id="nifnaq2jmn9">How did we get to the point where data science is used almost exclusively in the service of profit (for a few), surveillance (of the minoritized), and efficiency (amidst scarcity)? It’s worth stepping back to make an observation about the organization of the data economy: data are expensive and resource-intensive, so only already powerful institutions—corporations, governments, and elite research universities—have the means to work with them at scale. These resource requirements result in data science that serves the primary goals of the institutions themselves. We can think of these goals as the <em>three Ss</em>: science (universities), surveillance (governments), and selling (corporations). This is not a normative judgment (e.g., “all science is bad”) but rather an observation about the organization of resources. If science, surveillance, and selling are the main goals that data are serving, because that’s who has the money, then what other goals and purposes are going underserved?</p><p id="nd3hqk8ysa5">Let’s take “the cloud” as an example. As server farms have taken the place of paper archives, storing data has come to require large physical spaces. A project by the Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI) makes this last point plain (figure 1.7). In 2014, CLUI set out to map and photograph data centers around the United States, often in those seemingly empty in-between areas we now call <em>exurbs</em>. In so doing, it called attention to “a new kind of physical information architecture” sprawling across the United States: “windowless boxes, often with distinct design features such as an appliqué of surface graphics or a functional brutalism, surrounded by cooling systems.” The environmental impacts of the cloud—in the form of electricity and air conditioning—are enormous. A 2017 Greenpeace report estimated that the global IT sector, which is largely US-based, accounted for around 7 percent of the world’s energy use.

For a list of these CEOs, see Michael Haupt, “‘Data Is the New Oil’—A Ludicrous Proposition,” Medium, May 2, 2016. If you want to hear many people in a row say the phrase, check out the supercut by Neil Perry, “MyDataMyDollars_2018,” YouTube, January 28, 2019, &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/kKwr1Tp0TBA?t=587&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://youtu.be/kKwr1Tp0TBA?t=587&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">77</a> It’s a metaphor that resonates uncannily well—even more than they likely intended. The idea of data as some sort of untapped natural resource clearly points to the potential of data for power and profit once they are processed and refined, but it also helps highlight the exploitative dimensions of extracting data from their source—people—as well as their ecological cost. Just as the original oil barons were able to use their riches to wield outsized power in the world (think of John D. Rockefeller, J. Paul Getty, or, more recently, the Koch brothers), so too do the Targets of the world use their corporate gain to consolidate control over their customers. But unlike crude oil, which is extracted from the earth and then sold to people, data are both extracted from people and sold back to them—in the form of coupons like the one the Minneapolis teen received in the mail, or far worse.<a href="#fn-77-bottom" id="fn-77-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;For example, once advertising giants like Facebook and Google have your gender, they can turn around and use it against you. In 2018, Facebook was accused of gender discrimination because it permitted employers to show job ads only to men. Part of this hinges on corporations’ reluctance to take responsibility for any of the content that passes through their platforms: Is Facebook discriminating against women? Or merely letting its customers use Facebook data to discriminate? The news article about the suit says that “Facebook said that it was still reviewing the ads but that it generally did not take down job ads that exclude a gender.” See Noam Scheiber, “Facebook Accused of Allowing Bias Against Women in Job Ads,” &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;, September 18, 2018, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html&quot; class=&quot;url&quot;&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html&lt;/a&gt;. In another example, computer scientists scraped YouTube videos by transgender users and used their images (without consent) to try to train an algorithm to recognize transgender faces. People found their images included in scientific research papers about the technology when they had never granted permission. Because of cissexism, this kind of unethical practice poses severe risk of harm to transgender users in the form of discrimination and violence.

On the contrary, focusing on those <em>three Ss</em>—science, surveillance, and selling—to the exclusion of other possible objectives results in significant oversights with life-altering consequences. Consider the Target example as the flip side of the missing data on maternal health outcomes. Put crudely, there is no profit to be made collecting data on the women who are dying in childbirth, but there is significant profit in knowing whether women are pregnant.</p><p id="n5c7njdz7di">How might we prioritize different goals and different people in data science? How might data scientists undertake a feminist analysis of power in order to tackle bias at its source?

She followed the Serena Williams story with great interest and watched as Congress passed the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018. This bill funded the creation of maternal health review committees in every state and, for the first time, uniform and comprehensive data collection at the federal level. But even as more data have begun to be collected about maternal mortality, Seals Allers has remained frustrated by the public conversation: “The statistics that are rightfully creating awareness around the Black maternal mortality crisis are also contributing to this gloom and doom deficit narrative.

One of the major contributing factors to poor birth outcomes, as well as maternal and infant mortality, is biased care. Hospitals, clinics, and caregivers routinely disregard Black women’s expressions of pain and wishes for treatment.<a href="#fn-80-bottom" id="fn-80-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;See Jochen Profit, Jeffrey B.

To combat this, Irth operates like an intersectional Yelp for birth experiences. Users post ratings and reviews of their prenatal, postpartum, and birth experiences at specific hospitals and in the hands of specific caregivers. Their reviews include important details like their race, religion, sexuality, and gender identity, as well as whether they felt that those identities were respected in the care that they received. The app also has a taxonomy of bias and asks users to tick boxes to indicate whether and how they may have experienced different types of bias. Irth allows parents who are seeking care to search for a review from someone like them—from a racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and/or gender perspective—to see how they experienced a certain doctor or hospital.</p><p id="nznis7njaev">Seals Allers’s vision is that Irth will be both a public information platform, for individuals to find better care, and an accountability tool, to hold hospitals and providers responsible for systemic bias. Ultimately, she would like to present aggregated stories and data analyses from the platform to hospital networks to push for change grounded in women’s and parents’ lived experiences. “We keep telling the story of maternal mortality from the grave,” she says. “We have to start preventing those deaths by sharing the stories of people who actually lived.”<a href="#fn-81-bottom" id="fn-81-inline" data-node-type="footnote" data-value="&lt;p&gt;Kimberly Seals Allers, interview by Catherine D’Ignazio, February 26, 2019.&lt;/p&gt;" date-structured-value="" class="footnote">82</a></p><p id="n5ayahamf0x">Irth illustrates the fact that “doing good with data” requires being deeply attuned to the things that fall outside the dataset—and in particular to how datasets, and the data science they enable, too often reflect the structures of power of the world they draw from. In a world defined by unequal power relations, which shape both social norms and laws about how data are used and how data science is applied, it remains imperative to consider who gets to do the “good” and who, conversely, gets someone else’s “good” done to them.</p><h2 id="examine-power">Examine Power</h2><p id="nhrgx0zws6h">Data feminism begins by examining how power operates in the world today. This consists of asking <em>who questions</em> about data science: Who does the work (and who is pushed out)? Who benefits (and who is neglected or harmed)? Whose priorities get turned into products (and whose are overlooked)? These questions are relevant at the level of individuals and organizations, and are absolutely essential at the level of society. The current answer to most of these questions is “people from dominant groups,” which has resulted in a <em>privilege hazard</em> so acute that it explains the near-daily revelations about another sexist or racist data product or algorithm. The <em>matrix of domination</em> helps us to understand how the privilege hazard—the result of unequal distributions of power—plays out in different domains. Ultimately, the goal of examining power is not only to understand it, but also to be able to challenge and change it. In the next chapter, we explore several approaches for challenging power with data science.</p><div class="pub-notes"><h1>Footnotes</h1><ol><li id="fn-0-bottom"><span class="pub-note-content-component"><span></span><span><p>Serena Williams, “Meet Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. You have to check out link in bio for her amazing journey.

The Fourteenth Amendment explicitly excluded Native Americans from US citizenship—another instance of oppression being codified in the structural domain of the matrix of domination. In 1924, the passage of the Indian Citizenship Act granted joint US citizenship to all Native Americans, clearing the path for enfranchisement. But it would take until 1962 for the last US state (New Mexico) to change its laws so that all Native Americans could vote. Even then, obstacles abounded; the 1965 Voting Rights Act offered additional legal language to contest disenfranchisement, but that act is in the process of being dismantled by the Supreme Court (as of 2013, with <em>Shelby County v. Holder</em>), which threatens many of its protections. On the subject of voting rights in the United States, it’s also worth pointing out that Puerto Rico did not have universal suffrage until 1935, and like other US territories, still does not have voting power in the US Congress or representation in the electoral college.</p></span></span> <a href="#fn-14-inline" class="return-link">↩</a></li><li id="fn-15-bottom"><span class="pub-note-content-component"><span></span><span><p>Other disenfranchisement methods devised over the years have included undue wait times for registering to vote, having to pay a tax to vote, or having to take a test about the Constitution. Well through the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Black and brown people seeking to vote faced threats of bodily harm. Note that the history of voter suppression perpetrated by white people on people of color is not over. One need only consider the 2018 gubernatorial election in Georgia, in which Brian Kemp, secretary of state and a white man, presided over his own gubernatorial race against Stacey Abrams, a Black woman. In his capacity as secretary of state, his actions included purging voter rolls and putting fifty-three thousand voter registrations on hold, 70 percent of which were for voters of color. Long lines and technical problems plagued the election day efforts, and the NAACP and ACLU sued the state of Georgia for voting irregularities. In short, voter suppression—enacted in the disciplinary domain of the matrix of domination—is alive and well. See German Lopez, “Voter Suppression Really May Have Made the Difference for Republicans in Georgia,” Vox, November 7, 2018, <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida" class="url">https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/7/18071438/midterm-election-results-voting-rights-georgia-florida</a>.</p></span></span> <a href="#fn-15-inline" class="return-link">↩</a></li><li id="fn-16-bottom"><span class="pub-note-content-component"><span></span><span><p>Note that the disciplinary domain does not just have to do with government power and policy, but also with corporate, private, and institutional policies.

She is “causing trouble” or getting in the way of the happiness of others by bringing up the issue. For example, a personal killjoy moment from the book-writing process happened when Catherine shared the topic of the book with a former professor, who responded that she should stay focused on data literacy and not become one of those “grumpy feminists” who were uncomfortable with their sexuality and sought to make problems for people. For the record, Catherine is not grumpy, feels confident in her sexuality, and is working on the killjoy skills of making more feminist problems for people.

Once the model is trained, it is evaluated using another dataset—called a <em>test dataset</em>—to determine whether the model works only on the training data or whether it is likely to perform well with new data. Finally, once the model has been tested, it is evaluated again with what’s called a <em>benchmarking dataset</em>.

In early 2019, the AJL collaborated with the Center on Technology &amp; Privacy at Georgetown Law to launch the Safe Face Pledge, a set of four ethical commitments that businesses and governments make when using facial analysis technology.

Her goal was to situate the murders of women in a context of unequal gender relations. In this context, men use violence to systematically dominate and exert power over women. And the research bears this out. While male victims of homicide are more likely to have been killed by strangers, a 2009 report published by the World Health Organization and partners notes a “universal finding in all regions” that women are far more likely to have been murdered by someone they know. Femicide includes a range of gender-related crimes, including intimate and interpersonal violence, political violence, gang activity, and female infanticide. Such deaths are often depicted as isolated incidents and treated as such by authorities, but those who study femicides characterize them as a pattern of underrecognized and underaddressed systemic violence.

In 2018, Facebook was accused of gender discrimination because it permitted employers to show job ads only to men. Part of this hinges on corporations’ reluctance to take responsibility for any of the content that passes through their platforms: Is Facebook discriminating against women? Or merely letting its customers use Facebook data to discriminate? The news article about the suit says that “Facebook said that it was still reviewing the ads but that it generally did not take down job ads that exclude a gender.” See Noam Scheiber, “Facebook Accused of Allowing Bias Against Women in Job Ads,” <em>New York Times</em>, September 18, 2018, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html" class="url">https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/business/economy/facebook-job-ads.html</a>. In another example, computer scientists scraped YouTube videos by transgender users and used their images (without consent) to try to train an algorithm to recognize transgender faces. People found their images included in scientific research papers about the technology when they had never granted permission. Because of cissexism, this kind of unethical practice poses severe risk of harm to transgender users in the form of discrimination and violence. See James Vincent, “Transgender YouTubers Had Their Videos Grabbed to Train Facial Recognition Software,” <em>Verge</em>, August 22, 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180080/transgender-youtubers-ai-facial-recognition-dataset" class="url">https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/22/16180080/transgender-youtubers-ai-facial-recognition-dataset</a>.
