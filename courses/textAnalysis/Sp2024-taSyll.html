                  (You will probably have this installed from DIGIT 100 or 110.) The DIGIT program has purchased a site license for this software, which
                  is installed in Burke 153, Kochel 77, the Lilley Library computers, and Witkowski 109, as well as the computer labs in Hammermill. The license also permits
                  students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.</li>

                <li>We will ask you to install Python version 3.8 or
                    higher on your computer, and install PyCharm Edu to assist in learning and
                    writing Python code with syntax checking. Follow instructions and links from
                    Pycharm ( <a
                        href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet"
                        >https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet</a> ) paying attention to what you need for your own computer systems.
                    Feel free to download and explore Pycharm Edu on your own before we start
                    working with it together: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/"
                        >https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/</a>. Also, configure 
                    Anaconda so it is available to work within Pycharm following this guide: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html</a>. (We will provide guidance on this in class.)
              </li>
               
               <li>Zoom: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version" target="_blank">Make sure your Zoom installation is up-to-date</a>, and you are ready to
                  connect. Sometimes we will record portions of class meetings and tutorial sessions for future reference to share over Zoom. Look for these in Canvas Announcements and use the Zoom menu option in Canvas to access these meetings.</li>
                
                <li>We will use GitHub for for sharing code and for project management. Create an account (choose the free options) at the <a href="https://github.com ">https://github.com </a> and install the GitHub client software for your operating system on your own machine on your computer. (We will explain how to use git and GitHub this in our course.)</li>
                
                <li>We will use the Slack chat platform for discussion and for asking questions (see <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members">https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members</a>). Download and install the Slack client, configuring your account to use use your Penn State email address (the official address, which looks like xyz123@psu.edu, and not an alias based on your name that you may have set up), so you can join our Slack workspace: DIGIT-coders. When you receive an invitation to join this workspace you should accept.</li>
                <li>Later in the semester we may ask you to install a local copy of the eXist-db
                        XML database, which you can download from <a href="https://exist-db.org/"
                            >https://exist-db.org/</a>. </li>
                   
               
               <li>No coding experience? Don’t worry! Past students
                  in this course
                  who never saw anything like markup or XML code have designed projects (<a href="https://newtfire.org/courses/studentProjects.html" target="_blank">like these</a>) and even spoken about them at academic conferences! You will learn to develop
                  your own digital tools and how to manage digital projects as teamwork.
