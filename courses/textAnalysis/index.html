            <p>DIGIT 210: Lionpath class number: 5932. This course fulfills a core Digital
               Humanities requirement for the Digital Media, Arts, and Technology (DIGIT) major and

            <h2>Text Analysis: Course Description</h2>
            <p>This course orients you to text and document data formats, and engages you in
               hands-on activities to manipulate these: to translate unstructured texts into
               structure to mark, track, and explore complex data. In this course, you will learn
               methods for marking, extracting, and analyzing data from digital documents to produce
               infographics such as graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, which you will design in the
               context of real projects. This course is meant to be complementary with <a
                  href="../textEncoding/index.html">DIGIT 110: Text Encoding</a>, but where the
               emphasis in that course is on curating and preparing reading views of documents, this
               course concentrates on analyzing data. Neither
               course is meant to be a prerequisite for the other: you may take either one as a
               beginner. Returning students (in either semester) review and help mentor beginning
               students for overlapping units they have experienced in the other course.</p>
            
            <h2>Learning to Code: Our Context</h2>
            
            <p>You do not need any background at all with computer programming or web
               development to succeed in this course. 
               We teach practical programming as a foundational skill (like reading, writing, and
               arithmetic) that all students should experience regardless of major or background. We also teach it in the writerly context of clear communication and documentation, which helps to build communities and connect projects over long periods of time.
            </p>

                  <span class="smaller"> This book is optional, and I have not requested it at the bookstore. 
                     I have two copies and it is available in the Penn State Library as an e-book. 
                     This is really <strong>the</strong> authoritative word on XSLT and XPath, written by a
                     designer of the official W3C specifications of XSLT 2.0 that we’re using. We
                     are learning from this book ourselves and consult it frequently! We’re not
                     requiring that you buy it, but we recommend it to have a powerful reference at
                     your fingertips and for learning more on your own. There’s a kindle edition
                     available but poorly designed for searching, so we (actually) prefer the
                     hardcover print edition. If you’re going to purchase it, be sure you pick up
                     the latest edition (from 2008), and not the earlier versions.</span>

               <h3>Homework Exercises (30%):</h3>
               
               <p>To keep up with this class, you must work on exercises regularly. Each day will
                  involve some small assignment, to prepare you for the next of class, and to help
                  you to build your course project.  <b>90% Rule: </b>If students do not submit at
                  least 90% of the regular homework assignments, the grade for the homework portion
                  is based on the percentage of homework they completed. Students should therefore
                  aim to submit at least 90% of the regular homework assignments, and complete at
                  least 90% of the work in each component of the course. </p>
               
               
               <p>
                  <strong>About homework assignments:</strong>  Coding and project review exercises in this course are about your active learning, and not—as in other
                  courses—a way of testing whether you have already learned something we covered in
                  class or in an assigned reading. You may often need to look up how to do something
                  that you don’t already know how to do. Often, there will be multiple ways of accomplishing
                  the task and we are not simply looking for you to do things perfectly in just one
                  way. We are instead looking for a record of your learning process as you take on a
                  challenge. Documenting problems is key to learning, and sometimes just writing out
                  what you are trying to do helps lead you to a solution! There may be
                  times when you don’t get the result you want in the homework, and that is to be expected!
                  In those cases you can still get full credit for the assignment if you’ve made a serious
                  attempt and if you submit, along with your code, a description of what else you tried,
                  what results you expected, what results you got, and what you think went wrong. Getting
                  stuck is part of the learning process. You will see me get stuck sometimes, and I will need <em>your eyes</em> to help me fix something!
                  As long as you’ve described your understanding of the problem and your attempts
                  to resolve it on your own, you will do well: documentation of how you get stuck is key. One of our goals is to form a supportive coding community in this class, so we are comfortable with <em>unsticking</em> each other, 
               </p>
               
               <p>I will read and evaluate all student homework, and will post assessments on Canvas. 
                  Coding assignments are assessed as <strong><q>check plus</q></strong>, <strong><q>check</q></strong>, and <strong><q>check minus</q></strong>, or <strong><q>redo</q></strong>.
                  Don’t think of these as grades, since, if you resubmit a <q>redo</q> to correct a serious problem, you will receive full credit for the assignment. 
                  My comments on homework are feedback
                  for learning purposes. If you have
                  not engaged with the assignment adequately (whether that means solving the tasks or
                  discussing the coding obstacles you encountered and how you dealt with them), we will
                  ask you to meet with us to review the issues and then complete a followup (redo) task
                  in order to receive credit. For assignments with posted solutions, I will invite you to
                  review the posted solution on GitHub and comment on it (we will show you how to do
                  this) to address something you learned from the solution or did in a different way.
                  For some assignments where we review posted solutions and line-comments together in
                  person or in class, we will write back to you with individual comments only if your
                  specific submission raises an issue that we don’t address elsewhere. If we don’t return
                  your assignment, that means that we have nothing to add to our posted solution, but
                  should you have any specific questions after you’ve read our posted solution, please
                  ask the instructors.  And we will go over assignments together to get the class unstick on things in our regular class meetings.
               </p>
               
               
               
               <p>
                  <strong>Issue posts:</strong> Throughout the course, we’ll assign discussion posts on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub">our class GitHub site</a> in which you will respond to online readings or evaluate web resources. Your posting
                  should do more than
                  summarize the article or site (which you could just do by skimming or reading
                  the first paragraph), but should demonstrate a thoughtful reflection on
                  specific ideas and issues. When evaluating a web resource, don’t simply praise
                  or condemn it without going into details about why a key component is effective
                  or poorly designed. Good posts demonstrate care and reflection, and
                  you may choose to respond to the overarching ideas of a piece, or to selected
                  details of specific interest. These posts are scored as <q>check plus</q>, <q>check</q>, and <q>check minus</q>.
               </p>
               
               
               
               
               
               <h3>Participation: In Class and on GitHub (15%):</h3>
               
               <p> Coding and programming in real life is a social activity, and professionals in
                  the real world aren’t “know-it-all” experts who work alone, but rather are tuned
                  into discussion boards and regularly ask and answer questions to stay sharp and to
                  learn from their community. In this class, we want you to work together and talk
                  to each other and your instructors as your community resource, so we have built
                  this into our course participation grade as a formal expectation. <strong>Beginning by week two, we’ll expect each student to post at least once per
                     week on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub">our course GitHub repo</a></strong>, and we strongly encourage you
                  to do more than this minimum. Earn an <q>A</q> in participation by asking questions, making suggestions, and sharing helpful
                  resources you’ve found. Help each other out by trying to answer questions on GitHub
                  (and
                  read the instructor posts too as we wade in to help). Your instructors will likely
                  be dominating the class time as we model concepts and methods, so the GitHub Issues
                  board gives the students a good space to form into a coding community to help each
                  other and reflect together. Also, if you have a question about an assignment, <strong>always think of our GitHub Issues board as your first resource</strong> to
                  check for helpful hints and to post your questions, because others may have the
                  same question and answers are best shared! Of course you may e-mail us, but we
                  really prefer you go the discussion board first, and doing so is, after all, worth
                  course credit as your participation grade.
               </p>
               
               
               
               <h3>Tests (25%):</h3>
               
               <p>As scheduled throughout the course there will be a few (three or four) tests on the
                  concepts and various kinds of markup technologies we are learning in the course. 
                  All will be take-home or taken online in
                  between classes. They are open-book, open notes, but they must be completed
                  individually and are designed to demonstrate that you have learned from the class
                  material, coding assignments, and posted solutions. Tests may resemble homework
                  assignments, but unlike homework exercises, these are given letter grades. These
                  are given grades because they are evaluative and involve demonstrating what you
                  have learned after we have finished a coding unit. </p>
               
               
               
               <h3>Projects (30%):</h3>
               
               <p>This course involves working on a team-based semester project. Project work will be scheduled with paced due dates throughout the semester, and will give you experience with team work to explore a research question and to document methods and discoveries using the coding and text analysis technologies addressed in our course.</p> 
       
               
               <h3>Grading Scale:</h3>
               
               <p>Grades for the course are calcuated and posted on Canvas, and follow this standard
                  scale: A: 93-100%, A-:
                  90-92%, B+: 87-89%, B: 83-86%, B-: 80-82%, C+: 77-79%, C: 70-76%, D: 60-69%, F: 59% and below. In taking the course on a S / NC (pass-fail)
                  basis, students must earn a C to receive Satisfactory credit.

               <h2>Course Policies:</h2>
               <p>Each day we are covering material that builds on earlier material and assignments,
                  so your success depends upon regular attendance and completing each assignment on
                  time. </p>
               <!--    <h3>Attendance:</h3>-->
               <p><!--We strictly require your attendance, as it is not only a setback to yourself but
               to the entire class and the success of our projects if students are repeatedly
               absent. Students must attend at least 90% of our class meetings in order <strong>to pass</strong> the course (that is, a maximum of four absences for any reason). Late arrival—particularly
               a pattern of
               repeated late arrivals—may be counted as absences at our discretion. To be considered
               attending for a class period, you
               must be present in the classroom by the beginning of class and until class is
               dismissed. For your own sanity, do not miss two consecutive classes. If you are
               experiencing a genuine emergency or crisis, alert us and provide documentation.
               (We do not want you to attend class if you have a fever or flu-like symptoms! If
               you wish to be excused from two or more consecutive class
               meetings due to your own
               documented illness, please contact one of the following: the Office of the Vice
               President for Academic Affairs, Prof. Jackie Horrall (724-836-7482 or jhorrall at
               pitt.edu), our Campus Health Center (Pamela Reed, 724-836-9947 or
               pmr20 at pitt.edu), or the Director of Counseling, Gayle Pamerleau (gaylep at
               pitt.edu), who can then officially alert all of your professors.--></p>
               <h3>Due dates and why we need them:</h3>
               <p> Your daily homework for this course is time-sensitive! Coding assignments,
                  response posts, and other homework exercises must be uploaded to Canvas (or
                  GitHub or our web server as specified), by the due date and time indicated on the
                  class schedule. Homework assignments will be posted online to our class website
                  and linked from our schedule, so students who miss class are nevertheless expected
                  to consult the schedule and submit assignments on time. Because we post and share
                  answers to homework exercises after submission deadlines, we will usually not
                  accept late homework submissions. </p>
               <h3>Exam Policy:</h3>
               <p>All exams will be take-home, to do on your own time, with submissions due in
                  Canvas or by web submission. Because I will be posting answers and sharing them in
                  class, I do not allow people to write exams after the solutions are posted.
                  However, I will drop your lowest exam score for the class, so that you may miss
                  one exam without penalty. </p>
               <h3>Zoom Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>Our class meets regularly over Zoom. I am not putting a grade on your attendance,
                  but I will expect your active presence and interaction with me and your classmates
                  this semester, as we need to rely on each other to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>Our class can be fast-paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can
                  of our Zoom class sessions. Minimize distractions around you so you can
                  concentrate on our class when we are meeting. Also try to participate from a
                  location where you can speak freely.</p>
               <!--<h3>Attendance and Classroom Courtesy:</h3>
               <p>I am not calculating your attendance, but I will expect your active presence and
                  interaction with me and your classmates this semester, as we need to rely on each
                  other to learn and develop projects.</p>
               <p>Our class is fast paced and requires that we all be making the best use we can of
                  our in-person class sessions. Arriving late and leaving early (physically or
                  remotely!) disrupts the important collective mental activity of class. So does
                  in-class texting and checking your cell phone. Whether you are joining over Zoom
                  or in the physical classroom, I ask that you put mobile devices in Do Not Disturb
                  mode. While class is in progress, talking disruptively, leaving the classroom,
                  texting or using a cell phone or computer, reading a newspaper, or other
                  distracting behavior will be actively discouraged. </p>-->
              <!-- <h4>Covid and Attendance</h4>
               <p>When present on campus together this semester, whether in the classroom or
                  elsewhere, <em>always</em> wear a mask and wear it appropriately (over your mouth
                  and nose). We are being provided with some personal protective equipment (PPE) in
                  the form of plastic face shields to be worn <em>in addition to masks</em> if we
                  need to look at each other's computer screens. It is a good idea to bring hand
                  sanitizer with you to campus and sponge off your work area in class. I will ask
                  you to put on your mask if I see you without one, or to fix your mask if you are
                  not wearing it correctly. Non-compliance by any of us means we have to leave the
                  classroom immediately for our own safety, and I have to report anyone not masking
                  or distancing as a violation of the Student Code of Conduct. Remember, <em>My mask
                     protects you; your mask protects me.</em>
               </p>
               <p>Please do not attend our physical class if you are not feeling healthy! This is
                  not the semester to suffer through a fever or chills heroically to attend class in
                  person. Stay home, report symptoms, get tested. This applies to me as your
                  professor as well as to you!</p>-->
               <p> If you need to miss classes for health reasons, make arrangements with me and
                  your peers to catch up. We will always be meeting on line (via chat and GitHub
                  asynchronously and via Zoom for class meetings) and we will find ways to keep you
                  looped in.</p>
              <!-- <p><strong>Our Covid Mixed Mode</strong>: I am planning for the class to be meeting
                  in mixed ways, with some of you attending in Zoom and some of you in the
                  classroom. I hope we can maintain class meetings so we see each other in person
                  once per week before Thanksgiving, but we are ready to be fully remote when
                  needed. I am preparing much course material to be recorded and watched and read on
                  your own time. In-class meetings are paired with synchronized Zoom sessions so you
                  all, wherever you are, can talk to me live. Think of the in-class sessions as live
                  conversations where we share screens and discuss homework, tests, and
                  projects.</p>
               <p>Finally, if I feel as if we are risking our health with in-class meetings, I will
                  simply move us all to Zoom to protect our group. Our health comes first! </p>

               <p>If any of us, you students or me, are feeling sick, with COVID or flu-like, or
                  other serious ailments this semester, please contact Behrend Student Health &amp;

                  with the COVID pandemic, and we are taking on a great risk this semester.
                  Reporting in when you do not feel well is not shameful; it is responsible and
                  important to protect yourself and our community.</p>
               <p>Also, this semester may be more stressful than usual with so much uncertainty!
                  Many students at Penn State face personal challenges or have psychological needs
                  that may interfere with their academic progress, social development, or emotional
                  wellbeing. Seek help! The university offers a variety of confidential services to

               <h3>Equity</h3>
               <p>Penn State takes great pride to foster a diverse and inclusive environment for
                  students, faculty, and staff. Acts of intolerance, discrimination, or harassment
                  due to age, ancestry, color, disability, gender, gender identity, national origin,
                  race, religious belief, sexual orientation, or veteran status are not tolerated
                  and can be reported through Educational Equity via the Report Bias webpage (<a
                     href="http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/reportbias/</a>).</p>
               <h3>E-mail:</h3>
               <p>Each student is issued a University email address (username@psu.edu) upon
                  admission. This email address may be used by the University for official
                  communication with students. Students are expected to read email sent to this
                  account on a regular basis. Failure to read and react to University communications
                  in a timely manner does not absolve the student from knowing and complying with
                  the content of the communications. The University provides an email forwarding
                  service that allows students to read their email via other service providers
                  (e.g., Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo). Students who choose to forward their email from their
                  psu.edu address to another address do so at their own risk. If email is lost as a
                  result of forwarding, it does not absolve the student from responding to official
                  communications sent to their University email address. To forward email sent to
                  your University account, go to http://accounts.psu.edu, log into your account,
                  click on Edit Forwarding Addresses, and follow the instructions on the page. Be
                  sure to log out of your account when you have finished.  </p>
               <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
               <p> Penn State Erie, The Behrend College, puts a very high value on academic
                  integrity, and violations are not tolerated. Academic integrity is the pursuit of
                  scholarly activity in an open, honest and responsible manner. Academic integrity
                  is a basic guiding principle for all academic activity at The Pennsylvania State
                  University, and all members of the University community are expected to act in
                  accordance with this principle. Consistent with this expectation, the University’s
                  Code of Conduct states that all students should act with personal integrity;
                  respect other students’ dignity, rights and property; and help create and maintain
                  an environment in which all can succeed through the fruits of their efforts.
                  Academic integrity includes a commitment by all members of the University
                  community not to engage in or tolerate acts of falsification, misrepresentation or
                  deception. Such acts of dishonesty violate the fundamental ethical principles of
                  the University community and compromise the worth of work completed by others.”
                  (Senate Policy 49-20 and G-9 Procedures. Any violation of academic integrity will
                  receive academic and possibly disciplinary sanctions, including the possible
                  awarding of an XF grade which is recorded on the transcript and states that
                  failure of the course was due to an act of academic dishonesty. All acts of
                  academic dishonesty are recorded so repeat offenders can be sanctioned
                  accordingly. More information on academic integrity can be found at: <a
                     href="http://psbehrend.psu.edu/intranet/faculty-resources/academic-integrity/academic-integrity"

               <p>
                  <strong>Source Citation and Plagiarism:</strong> One goal of our course is to
                  reflect on how best to cite sources in digital contexts. We will consider how and
                  why such citations differ from documenting printed texts. We will also consider
                  the ease and frequency with which digital texts and graphics are plagiarized on
                  the worldwide web, and discuss how the omission of source citations detracts from
                  the authority of a digital information resource. We expect you to practice mindful
                  source citation, and plagiarism on your part will have very serious consequences. </p>
               <p>Representing the voice of another individual as your own voice constitutes
                  plagiarism, however generous that person may be in “helping” you with an
                  assignment. Turning in an assignment generated collectively under the name of a
                  single individual is considered plagiarism. <strong>When instructed to collaborate
                     on a project, project collaborators share collective authorship and should
                     identify themselves directly as a team.</strong> To avoid plagiarism, cite your
                  sources whenever you quote, paraphrase, or summarize material, or use digital
                  images from any outside source (including websites, articles, books, course
                  readings, Courseweb or GitHub postings, or someone else’s notes). When using the
                  “copy” and “paste” features as you read and research, be sure that you are
                  carefully marking that these passages are unprocessed from their source, so that
                  you know to process it later. Forgetting to do so not only produces sloppy work
                  but (whether you intended it or not) results in a false representation. As long as
                  you make a good faith and clear effort to cite your sources, you will not be
                  faulted for plagiarism, but your work will be penalized if citations are
                  inaccurate, unclear, or lack important information. </p>
               <p>That said, the coding and digital development we do encourages collaboration, and
                  for that reason we adopt our colleague David Birnbaum's <a
                     href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/collaboration.xhtml">Collaboration policy</a>,
                  since his course is very similar to ours. This policy specifies that students
                  identify collaborators in a comment on submitted asignments and take care on
                  projects that all students contribute equally (and no student is contributing
                  excessively more than what everyone else has done). When joining a group homework
                  session, always work on the assignment by yourself first so you can be an equal
                  participant, and write up the assignment <em>by yourself, after</em> the session
                  is over so you take care not to copy from the other students. While we want you to
                  consult with each other, you are responsible for doing all your writing and coding
                  by yourself, using your own words. </p>
               <h3>Disability Services:</h3>
               <p>Penn State welcomes students with disabilities into the University’s educational
                  programs. Every Penn State campus has an office for students with disabilities.
                  Student Disability Resources (SDR) website provides contact information for every
                  Penn State campus (<a href="http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator"
                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/disability-coordinator</a>). For further
                  information, please visit Student Disability Resources website (<a

                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/</a>). In order to receive consideration for
                  reasonable accommodations, you must contact the appropriate disability services
                  office at the campus where you are officially enrolled, participate in an intake
                  interview, and provide documentation: See documentation guidelines (<a

                     >http://equity.psu.edu/sdr/guidelines</a>). If the documentation supports your
                  request for reasonable accommodations, your campus disability services office will
                  provide you with an accommodation letter. Please share this letter with your
                  instructors and discuss the accommodations with them as early as possible. You
                  must follow this process for every semester that you request accommodations. Penn

                        and His Times</a>: The very thoughtful stylistic design of this important
                     project reproduces the style of nineteenth-century print and layout. The content
                     makes many rare materials about Lord Byron’s social network searchable and
                     connected to the web of linked open data.

                     <a href="http://shelleygodwinarchive.org/">The Shelley-Godwin Archive</a>:
                     digitizes the manuscripts of Percy and Mary Shelley, and Mary Shelley’s parents,
                     William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft—manuscripts often written in multiple
                     hands. Provides an important study of the Frankenstein notebooks to demonstrate
                     how much of a role Percy Shelley played in the writing of Frankenstein. The
                     archive provides a good model of the use of TEI for manuscript encoding and of
                     complex and multiple visualizations of manuscript texts.
