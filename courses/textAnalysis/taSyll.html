            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus computing
               labs, too.

               <li><a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html" target="_blank">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. 
                  The DIGIT program has purchased a site license for this software, which
                  is installed in Kochel 77, the Lilley Library computers, and Witkowski 109. The license also permits
                  students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.</li>
               
               <li>Zoom: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version" target="_blank">Make sure your Zoom installation is up-to-date</a>, and you are ready to
                  connect. The Zoom link for our regularly scheduled class meetings is posted in
                  Canvas: Look for the Zoom menu option. </li>
                
                <li>We will use GitHub for for sharing code and for project management. Create an account (choose the free options) at the <a href="https://github.com ">https://github.com </a> and install the GitHub client software for your operating system on your own machine on your computer. (We will explain how to use git and GitHub this in our course.)</li>
                
                <li>We will use the Slack chat platform for discussion and for asking questions (see <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members">https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members</a>). Download and install the Slack client, configuring your account to use use your Penn State email address (the official address, which looks like xyz123@psu.edu, and not an alias based on your name that you may have set up), so you can join our Slack workspace: DIGIT-coders. When you receive an invitation to join this workspace you should accept.</li>
                <li>Later in the semester we will ask you to install local copies of the eXist-db
                        XML database, which you can download from <a href="https://exist-db.org/"
                            >https://exist-db.org/</a>. We will go through the installation process
                        with you when the time comes, since it can be confusing the first time, and
                        we recommend that you not install this application now in any case because
                        it is updated frequently, and there is likely to be a more advanced version
                        available by the time we need it. If you want to
                        install it early in order to begin to experiment with it, we recommend that
                        instead of the Latest Stable Release (version 5.2.0 as we write this) you
                        install the most recent Nightly Build; after you click on the link from the
                        main eXist-db page, scroll down past the FusionDB (which is a different
                        product than eXist-db) nightly builds to reach the eXist-db nightly
                        builds.</li>
                    <li>Later in the semester, we will ask you to install Python version 3.7 or
                        higher on your computer, and install PyCharm Edu to assist in learning and
                        writing Python code with syntax checking. Follow instructions and links from
                        Pycharm ( <a
                            href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet"
                            >https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet</a> ) paying attention to what you need for your own computer systems.
                        Feel free to download and explore Pycharm Edu on your own before we start
                        working with it together: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/"
                            >https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/</a>. Also, configure Anaconda so it is available to work within Pycharm following this guide: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html</a>. As with eXist-dB, we will also go over the installation of this and
                        setting up a Python environment on your computer. </li>
               
               
               <li>We may be publishing projects on our web server, newtfire. To access this, you will need secure file transfer (SFTP) for homework
                  assignments and projects (also available in the campus computer labs). There are
                  several good options available. We recommend you download and install on your own
                  computers one (or more) of the following, depending on your platform: (Feel free
                  to experiment with these and others!)

                        target="_blank">Install Cytoscape on your computer</a>, together
                        with the appropriate Java package. Note: This is also installed in the
                        campus computer labs, so you may work with it there, too or instead of
                        on your own computer. If you have trouble with the installation,
                        locate Cytoscape in the campus computer labs. Begin familiarizing
                        yourself with the Cytoscape interface, working with Cytoscape session
                        files (with .cys extension) posted in Class Examples, Network-Workshop
                        folder in our textAnalysis-Hub. Try importing one of my Cytoscape
                        session files (.cys) following our tutorial instructions. </p>
