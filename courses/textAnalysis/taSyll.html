                Classes meet <strong>M W F 1:25 - 2:15pm in Witkowski 109</strong>. Attend class wearing a face mask that covers your mouth and nose. 
                (Until further notice, face masks are required inside all university buildings, regardless of vaccination status.) 
                Remember: <em>Your mask protects me, my mask protects you.</em>

            <p>Download and install the following software on your own personal computer(s) on or
               before the first day of class. These software tools are available in our campus computing
               labs, too.
               </p>

               <li><a href="https://www.oxygenxml.com/xml_editor.html" target="_blank">&lt;oXygen/&gt;</a>. 
                  The DIGIT program has purchased a site license for this software, which
                  is installed in Kochel 77, the Lilley Library computers, and Witkowski 109. The license also permits
                  students enrolled in the
                  course to install the software on their home computers (for course-related use
                  only). When installing this on your own computers, <strong>you will need the
                     license key</strong>, which we have posted on our course Announcements section of
                  <a href="https://canvas.psu.edu" target="_blank">Canvas</a>.</li>
               
               <li>Zoom: <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362233-Upgrade-update-to-the-latest-version" target="_blank">Make sure your Zoom installation is up-to-date</a>, and you are ready to
                  connect. Sometimes we will record portions of class meetings and tutorial sessions for future reference to share over Zoom. Look for these in Canvas Announcements and use the Zoom menu option in Canvas to access these meetings.</li>
                
                <li>We will use GitHub for for sharing code and for project management. Create an account (choose the free options) at the <a href="https://github.com ">https://github.com </a> and install the GitHub client software for your operating system on your own machine on your computer. (We will explain how to use git and GitHub this in our course.)</li>
                
                <li>We will use the Slack chat platform for discussion and for asking questions (see <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members">https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-members</a>). Download and install the Slack client, configuring your account to use use your Penn State email address (the official address, which looks like xyz123@psu.edu, and not an alias based on your name that you may have set up), so you can join our Slack workspace: DIGIT-coders. When you receive an invitation to join this workspace you should accept.</li>
                <li>Later in the semester we will ask you to install local copies of the eXist-db
                        XML database, which you can download from <a href="https://exist-db.org/"
                            >https://exist-db.org/</a>. We will go through the installation process
                        with you when the time comes, since it can be confusing the first time, and
                        we recommend that you not install this application now in any case because
                        it is updated frequently, and there is likely to be a more advanced version
                        available by the time we need it. If you want to
                        install it early in order to begin to experiment with it, we recommend that
                        instead of the Latest Stable Release (version 5.3.1 as we write this) you
                        install the most recent Nightly Build; after you click on the link from the
                        main eXist-db page, scroll down past the FusionDB (which is a different
                        product than eXist-db) nightly builds to reach the eXist-db nightly
                        builds.</li>
                    <li>Later in the semester, we will ask you to install Python version 3.7 or
                        higher on your computer, and install PyCharm Edu to assist in learning and
                        writing Python code with syntax checking. Follow instructions and links from
                        Pycharm ( <a
                            href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet"
                            >https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/quick-start-guide.html#meet</a> ) paying attention to what you need for your own computer systems.
                        Feel free to download and explore Pycharm Edu on your own before we start
                        working with it together: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/"
                            >https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm-edu/</a>. Also, configure Anaconda so it is available to work within Pycharm following this guide: <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/conda-support-creating-conda-virtual-environment.html</a>. As with eXist-dB, we will also go over the installation of this and
                        setting up a Python environment on your computer. </li>
               
               <li>No coding experience? Don’t worry! Past students
                  in this course
                  who never saw anything like markup or XML code have designed projects (<a href="https://newtfire.org/courses/studentProjects.html" target="_blank">like these</a>) and even spoken about them at academic conferences! You will learn to develop
                  your own digital tools and how to manage digital projects as teamwork.
