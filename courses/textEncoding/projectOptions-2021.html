            <h3>Semester project overview</h3>
            <p>Your task is to create a small digital edition that represents a source document (or
                set of source documents) in a way that helps make data and metadata visible and
                available to explore as an exhibit on the world-wide web. Your project will involve
                making decisions to mark up the document(s) in XML according to a schema that you
                define either in Relax NG, or (with consultation) a TEI ODD. Your XML markup can be
                one or or multiple files. It should engage with information you determine to be
                meaningful and important to illuminate for a wider audience. This should
                include:</p>

                    </li>
                    <li>Data you think is worth marking, collecting, organizing, studying, assessing
                        in the document text, such as: <ul>
                            <li>language patterns of any kind that interest you</li>
                            <li>historical references</li>
                            <li>places: mappable or fictional or mythical</li>

                </ul>
<p>You will be preparing your project files in a GitHub repository that you will share with a group of students working as a project team. Part of this project is curating and documenting your code in the repo, and part of it involves publishing your work to a website hosted on the repo using GitHub Pages and HTML and CSS code that you write yourself as you learn these units in our course.</p>
            </section>

            <p>Your encoding of this text will involve some decision making and investigation of a
                research question that you can help to answer using systematic XML markup. You will
                transform your XML with XSLT into HTML and style it to prepare a web exhibit of the
                document that is more than just a reading view, but is designed to share information
                and contexts you have learned about the text with a wider audience.</p>
            <p>You have a choice of documents to work with. Based on your choices, groups of you
                will form a small community that will be producing a range of web exhibits on this
                text as you are learning to process and transform your XML in this course. Each
                group is to review its code and share it in a team GitHub repository associated with
                your text. You will be preparing a website from this GitHub repository using GitHub
                Pages, which will make a research exhibit of the document. Your team may opt to
                represent alternative distinct exhibits of the document based on your distinct
                approaches. Each student is expected to prepare markup and write to a schema
                individually by a set due date in November. Then as we work on XSLT transformations,
                coordinate with your group to compare your markup, prepare a shared team GitHub
                repository, and to prepare and style the most interesting or remarkable
                transformations in a web exhibit using GitHub Pages.</p>
