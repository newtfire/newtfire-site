            <h3>Analysis of the task</h3>
            <p>The goals of this assignment are:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Create a personal remote repository on GitHub via website</li>
                <li>Set up GitHub Pages to run a website on your personal GitHub repo</li>
                <li>Make a starter page on your new GitHub Pages site.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Upon completion of this assignment you should feel confident about interacting on GitHub and working with files on your web repo. Our DIGIT courses
                require regular GitHub activity, so if you still feel uncertain on
                how to use Git or GitHub after completing this assignment please meet with an
                instructor. We will gladly assist you so you feel comfortable using GitHub on a regular basis.</p>

            <h3>Step By Step</h3>
           
            <p>To create a new repo, go to your GitHub profile on the web: Go to https://github.com and login, then find your personal profile. 
                Select the <q>Repositories</q> tab, and click <q>New</q>.</p>
            <p><img src="NewRepo_GitEx1.jpg" alt="GitHub Create Repo" /></p>
            <p>Give your repo a logical name (i.e. my_site), a brief description, and select
                    <q>public</q>. <strong>During this course we ask you to keep this repo public</strong> so we can
                view each other’s site development without everyone in the course having to be added
                as a collaborator; however, you can switch this to private in the future.</p>
           
            <p>Next, navigate on GitHub to your personal page repo, and follow our
                    <a href="explainGitShell.html#collaborators" target="_blank">tutorial steps to
                    add a collaborator</a>. Add your instructor(s) to your repo: Invite Dr. B as <code>@ebeshero</code>. After the
                completion of this course you can remove any unwanted collaborators; however, for
                this assignment we want you to practice adding at least one collaborator. Also when
                creating your own repo you may need to change the settings to include an issues
                board; follow these <a target="_blank"
                    href="https://help.github.com/articles/managing-projects-with-issues/"
                    >help.github.com directions</a> to do so if the <q>Issues</q> tab is not automatically there.</p>
            
           <p>Now, configure your repository to support a GitHub Pages website. To do this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find the Settings tab on your repo. (This is a tab like Issues, only all the way on the right.)
                <img src="git_shell/RepoSettings.png" alt="find the Settings tab on your GitHub repository" width="1000"/>
                </li>
                <li>Inside Settings, select Options and scroll down until you see GitHub Pages.</li>
                <li>Under GitHub Pages look for Source. 
                <ul>
                    <li>Select the drop-down menu under source, and select the <b>Main</b>
                            branch.</li>
                    <li>As soon as you do that, a second drop-down menu appears. On this select <strong>/docs</strong>. This makes it possible for a special directory in your repo to be set to deliver your website. 
                        (In future classes you may want to use this repo for more than developing a website, so by setting up a <strong>docs</strong> directory, you give yourself more options for later.) You will need to create a file folder in your repo called <code>docs</code> to match this.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                 <li>When satisfied with your settings (so that they look like the image below), click the Save button.
                     <img src="git_shell/SetupGitHubPages.png" alt="How to configure GitHub Pages" width="1000"/>
                  
                </li>
                <li>Now, you will be preparing a very simple <code>index.html</code> page and save it in the <code>docs</code> directory. The <code>index.html</code> page is the <q>landing page</q> on a website: It is always the first page in the web directory that displays when someone visits your website. For now, just as we are getting started, you can write this code directly in the web browser, though we will not normally be doing this. (On the next assignments, you will be working with the oXygen XML Editor which will help with error-correcting the syntax of your code as you build your pages.)
                    <ol><li>Go to the Code tab of your repo and click the <q>Add File</q> button. Then, create a docs directory and start your new file by typing in:
                <code>docs/index.html</code>.</li> 
                        <li>Here is some very simple code for launching the base <code>index.html</code> page required for your website:
                    <h4>Code Block: </h4>
                            <p>Just to initiate your website, click the <q>Edit new file</q> window in the docs/ directory, and copy this simple code and paste it into window: </p>
                    <pre>
                        &lt;html&gt;
                             &lt;head&gt;
                                 &lt;title&gt;My new webpage&lt;/title&gt;
                             &lt;/head&gt;
                             &lt;body&gt;
                                  &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
                             &lt;/body&gt;
                        &lt;/html&gt;
                    </pre>
                            <p>Here is how it looks to paste that code into the <q>Edit new file</q> view on your new document.</p>
                            <img src="git_shell/startIndexhtml.png" alt="create a docs directory and an index.html page" width="1200"/>
                        </li>
                </ol>
                </li>
               <!-- <li><strong>If you do not know HTML or prefer to use Markdown</strong> and a custom Jekyll theme, do the following:
                     <ol><li>Under Settings, select <q>Choose a theme</q>. Browse the themes and select one to use for your site.</li>
                         
                         <li>Then, go to the Code tab of your repo and click the <q>Add File</q> button. Create a docs directory and a new Markdown file named index.md by typing in <code>docs/index.md</code>. Write some markdown to initiate your GitHub pages site.  
                         </li>
                     </ol>
                   <img src="git_shell/startIndexmd.png" alt="create a docs directory and an index.md page in Markdown" width="1200"/>
                </li>
                </ul>
                </li>-->
                <li>Finally, go back to Settings on your GitHub repo. Scroll down to GitHub Pages where you configured its settings. 
                If you configured your <code>docs</code> directory and a new index file in it, you should now see the <strong>github.io</strong> website address where you can view your published index.html.
                    The site we configured for the introDH-Hub is published at <a href="https://newtfire.github.io/introDH-Hub/">https://newtfire.github.io/introDH-Hub/</a>. Follow your link to see what your new site looks like!</li>
                <li>We do not recommend continuing to work with the <q>Edit new file</q> window in your GitHub repository! This is just a simple start as you are learning. Instead, you will work on editing your files locally in the oXygen XML Editor and using git commands to send your files to the remote GitHub repo. You will learn how to do that in the next homework assignments.</li>
                    <li>As you begin constructing your site, you will notice
                    some lag time in publishing your updates. Be patient. Sometimes it takes a few minutes, but your website updates will post!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Congratulations!</h3>
            <p>Welcome to the Git community! You have successfully completed the basic tasks of
                setting up a GitHub repository on your personal account and preparing th start of a website on GitHub Pages! <!--If you do not like the theme, you can change it in your repo’s settings. Or you can customize it, which we will work on later. --> You will be developing this site and writing code to style it in the next series of assignments. For now, you are ready to submit Git Exercise 2 by going to Canvas, finding the appropriate Assignment link, and <strong>entering the URL (web address) for your new GitHub Pages site</strong>.
