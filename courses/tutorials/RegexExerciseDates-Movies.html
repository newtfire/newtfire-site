            XML</span></h1>
        <p>Consult the following resources as you work with Regular Expressions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="explainRegex.html">Our newtFire tutorial on Autotagging with Regular
                    Expressions (Regex)</a>

        </ul>
        <h3>Get the source text ready in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
        <p>We downloaded some data about movies from the 1930s to 2018 in a spreadsheet and saved it
            as a plain-text file, which you can download from our site here: <a href="movieData.txt"
                >movieData.txt</a>. (Spreadsheets can be saved as <q>raw</q> text in tab-separated or
            comma-separated format. We saved ours with tabs as separators, because some of the movie
            titles contain commas.) Working with text saved with tab-separated values can be a good way to orient yourself to regular expression patterns.
        Our goal is to apply regular expressions to convert this text document (with thousands of lines) into an XML document without coding by hand!
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To download the file, go to File and Save as in your web browser, and choose a
                useful name and location on your computer to save the file. We typically keep the
                    <code>.txt</code> extension, and you might rename this as
                    <code>YourName_MovieData.txt</code>.) </li>
            <li>Then open &lt;oXygen/&gt;, and open the file you saved.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Prepare a <q>Step File</q></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Next, open a <strong>new, separate text file</strong>, in which you will record each
                step you take in up-converting this document to XML. This needs to be a plain text
                    (<code>*.txt</code>) or markdown (<code>*.md</code>) file and not something you
                write in a word processor (<em>not</em> a Microsoft Word document) so you do not
                have to struggle with autocorrections of the regex patterns you are recording.</li>
            <li>Save this file as your main homework submission for this assignment, following our
                    <a href="http://dh.newtfire.org/explainFileNames.html">standard homework file
                    naming conventions</a> for upload to Canvas. We will duplicate the steps you
                record to make sure they work to up-convert the text file to XML. <span
                    class="smaller"><strong>Suggestions:</strong> You can open a new markdown file
                    in &lt;oXygen/&gt; by going to open a New document (the folded piece of paper
                    icon) and typing in <q>markdown</q> in the search bar. (Or type in <q>text</q>
                    to open a new plain text file.)<strong> On Windows</strong>, you can find and
                    open Notepad and record your steps in plain text form here outside of oXygen,
                    which may be convenient, so you don’t accidentally try your find-and-replace
                    operations on your step file instead of the main text. <strong>On Mac</strong>,
                    you might try TextEdit, or stick with &lt;oXygen/&gt; and open your window in
                    Tile View as we did with your Relax NG Schema files.</span>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>The task</h3>
        <p>Your goal is to produce an XML version of the movie data file by using the
            search-and-replace techniques we discussed in class, <strong>and</strong> record each
            step you take in a plain text or markdown file so others can reproduce exactly what you
            did. <span class="smaller">(You may, in a real-life project situation, need to share the
                steps you take in up-converting plain text documents to XML, and share that on your
                GitHub repo in GitHub’s markdown (the same that we write on the GitHub Issues
                board), and in that case you would save the file with a <code>.md</code> extension,
                like <a
                    href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/blob/master/Class-Examples/Regex/elderScrolls/regexToMarkdownList.md"
                    >this sample regex instructions file.</a>).</span></p>
        <p>Your up-converted XML output should look something like <strong><a href="movieData.xml"
                    >movieData.xml</a></strong>. This involves putting each class period date in its
            own element and reformatting it to hold the full date information in an attribute. It
            also involves wrapping the three (M W and F) class period dates for each week in an
            element to wrap the weeks. </p>
        <p>Your <q>Steps file</q> needs to be detailed enough to indicate each step of your process:
            what regular expression patterns you attempted to find, and what expressions you used to
            replace them. You might record the number finds you get and even how you fine-tuned your
            steps when you were not finding everything you wanted to at first.
                <strong>Note:</strong> we strongly recommend <strong>copying and pasting your find
                and replace expressions</strong> into your Steps file instead of retyping them
            (since it is easy to introduce errors that way).</p>
        <h3>How to proceed</h3>
        <p>There are several ways to get to the target output, but the starting points are
            standard:</p>
        <h4>Starting work:</h4>
        <p>First of all, for any up-conversion of plain text, you must check for the special reserve
            characters: the ampersand <code>&amp;</code> and the angle brackets <code>&lt;</code>
            and <code>&gt;</code>. You need to search for those and, if they turn up, replace them
            with their corresponding XML entities, so that these will not interfere with well-formed
            XML markup.</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Search for:</th>
                <th>Replace with:</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&amp;</code></td>
                <td><code>&amp;amp;</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&lt;</code></td>
                <td><code>&amp;lt;</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>&gt;</code></td>
                <td><code>&amp;gt;</code></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <p>Note that you need to process the special XML reserve characters in the correct order.
            Why is it important that you search and replace the <code>&amp;</code> first?</p>
        <p>To perform regex searching, you need to check the box labeled <q>Regular expression</q>
            at the bottom of the &lt;oXygen/&gt; find-and-replace dialog box, which you open with
            Control-f (Windows) or Command-f (Mac). If you don’t check this box, &lt;oXygen/&gt;
            will just search for what you type literally, and it won’t recognize that some
            characters in regex have special meaning. You don’t have to check anything else yet. Be
            sure that <q>Dot matches all</q> is unchecked, though; we’ll explain why below.</p>
        <h4>How to approach the conversion process</h4>
        <p>Our data is organized in lines of text, so we recommend starting by wrapping those lines
            in a simple <q>wrapper</q> element (<code>&lt;movie&gt;....&lt;/movie&gt;</code> to
            isolate each line of data about each movie. We can then proceed to fine-tune the markup
            and add more inside each move element working around the tab characters.</p>
        <h4>Find and Replace: Working with Capturing Groups</h4>
        <p>From each text row of movie data, we ultimately want to create this pretty-printed,
            structured XML markup (showing a sample of the data for the movie <em>Operation
                Dunkirk</em>:</p>
        <pre>
               &lt;movie&gt;
               &lt;title&gt;Operation Dunkirk&lt;/title&gt;
               &lt;date&gt;2017&lt;/date&gt;
               &lt;location&gt;USA&lt;/location&gt;
               &lt;time unit="min"&gt;96&lt;/time&gt;
           &lt;/movie&gt;
           </pre>
        <p>To get to this point, start by looking at the lines in the text file as you have it open
            in oXygen. You'll see that each line is numbered. We can try working on this data from
            the <q>outside in</q>, that is, wrap each whole line in a wrapper element so each
            movie’s data is contained in tags: </p>
        <pre>Operation Dunkirk	2017	USA	96 min</pre>
        <p>Use a Find and Replace operation to isolate each line with a simple regular expression.
            Then, in your replace, refer to the Find expressing to <dfn>capture</dfn> it, either as
            a whole unit, or as a capturing group.</p>
        <pre>&lt;movie&gt;Operation Dunkirk	2017	USA	96 min&lt;/movie&gt;</pre>
        <p>The way regex really thinks of this process is, <q>match every movie line, delete it, and
                replace it with remixed pieces of itself wrapped in <code>&lt;movie&gt;</code>
                tags</q>. That is, regex doesn’t think about leaving the movie line in place and
            inserting something before and after it; it thinks about matching each movie line,
            deleting it, and then putting the whole thing back, with the tags that you desire. You
            need to refer to what you want to keep (in this case the whole thing), as a
                <dfn>capturing group</dfn>. When we want to keep the whole expression that we found,
            the whole line of text here, we refer to capturing group 0 with <code>\0</code>. </p>
        <h4>More fun with capturing groups</h4>
        <p>Once you have isolated the movie lines and wrapped them in start and end tags, it is time
            to apply more detailed markup inside, to isolate each movie title, date, and location.
            We will do something special with the time unit, remixing that data to put the unit
            inside an attribute value. To do this work, you will need to learn how to mark and apply
                <dfn>capturing groups</dfn>. </p>
        <p>To make <strong>capturing groups</strong> you set parentheses around the portions of your
            regular expression that you want to keep. Think of setting capturing groups as a way to
            isolate pieces of your <q>Find</q> so that you can point to them and position them
            exactly where you want in your <q>Replace></q>. Take your first step by locating the
                <code>&lt;movie&gt;</code> start tag that you just set down followed by just the
            movie title (which is bordered by a tab character). Once you can find these things, wrap
            the element tag in its own capturing group, and then the title information in second
            capturing group.</p>
        <p>In the replace, you will need to refer to the capturing groups using a special regular
            expression. The sequence <code>\1</code> points to the first capturing group, ordered
            from left to right. <code>\2</code> refers to the second capturing group. Remember, the
            expression <code>\0</code> refers to the entire match regardless of the capturing
            groups. Try experimenting with Find and Replace using capturing groups in various ways
            until you set down the tagging you want. (The Undo button in oXygen is under the Edit
            menu, and we use it frequently when we are experimenting like this!)</p>
        <p>We are not going to tell you how to create your regular expressions: part of the learning
            process here is <q>looking stuff up</q> in the tutorial sites we have provided, and
            asking for help when you get stuck on our DIGIT-Coders Slack or by opening an issue on
            our textAnalysis-Hub. Do your best to wrap the data you see in meaningful tags, even if
            what you create does not look exactly like our sample XML.</p>
        <h4>Cleaning up and checking your results</h4>
        <p>Save your text file now as an XML file by saving as <code>.xml</code>. You will now need
            to <strong>reopen the document</strong> to see if it is well-formed so that oXygen
            actually recognizes and reads the file as an XML document. <strong>It probably is not
                well-formed</strong>, because you need to wrap the document in a root element. Do
            that and inspect the document for well-formedness. To check for well-formedness in the
            XML file, you can use Control+Shift+W on Windows, Command+Shift+W on Mac, or click on
            the arrow next to the red check mark in the icon bar at the top and choose <q>Check
                well-formedness</q>. If you see regular patterns of something that you can fix with
            regular expressions, use them and document your steps.</p>
        <h4>General</h4>
        <p>As we mention above, there are several ways to get to the target output, and whatever
            works is legitimate, as long as you make meaningful use of computational tools,
            including regular expressions (where appropriate), and don’t just tag everything
            manually. As you saw in class, there are ways to build your own regular expressions to
            match whatever patterns you need to identify, and the regex languages is complex and
            often difficult to read. The way we would approach this task is by figuring out what we
            need to match and then looking up how to match it. In addition to the mini-tutorial
            above, there is a more comprehensive tutorial information at <a
                href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html"
                >http://www.regular-expressions.info/tutorialcnt.html</a>. If you decide to look
            around for alternative reference sites and find something that seems especially useful,

            it.</p>
        <h3>What to submit</h3>
        <p>On Canvas, upload two things (or a zip directory containing the following):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a step file as a markdown (<code>.md</code>) or plain text (<code>.txt</code>)
                document (a step-by-step description of what you did), and</li>
            <li>your results file (the XML document as <code>.xml</code>)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you don’t get all the way to a solution, just upload the description of what you did,
            what the output looked like, and why you were not able to proceed any further. As you
            are working on this, post any questions on Slack or our class GitHub Issues board!</p>
