        <h1><span class="banner">TEI ODD Exercise: Customizing and Documenting the TEI</span></h1>
        <section title="objectives">
            <h3>Introducing TEI ODD with the Mary Behrend 1909 Calendar</h3>
            <p>Up to this point, we have been applying code based on researching the Guidelines of
                the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) and seeing what is available to us in the oXygen
                XML Editor on a TEI-All document. TEI projects often begin this way, exploring what
                is possible in the hundreds of elements and attribute options available. However,
                sooner or later as a project continues, it is best to <dfn>customize</dfn> the TEI
                by reducing the options we want to be available within a project. <em>What elements are we
                actually using and how much of the TEI do we really need?</em></p>
            <p>Customizing the TEI involves a process of generating a new Relax NG schema that typically represents a
                much smaller subset of the TEI. We could also introduce some of our own custom
                elements from outside the TEI (as in make up some elements that are not otherwise
                represented in the TEI Guidelines), but that is a little more advanced and usually
                unecessary for most TEI projects.</p>
            <p>So, how do we access the TEI Relax NG schema? Because the TEI represents such a large schema, we
                do not edit its Relax NG directly. (TEI Relax NG is typically expressed in
                the verbose XML syntax because it requires some functionality from XML processing
                code that is not available in the Relax NG Compact Syntax you have learned to
                write.) Instead, to customize the TEI, we work with a TEI language called
                    <dfn>ODD</dfn> for <strong><q>One Document Does it all</q></strong>. ODD syntax concisely
                expresses in XML which <dfn>modules</dfn> of the TEI we are working with (clusters of TEI
                elements grouped based on their functionality and purpose; currently there are 20
                modules as of this writing in 2022). In preparing an ODD, when we represent a module, we can also
                indicate which of its elements we want to <dfn>include</dfn> (throwing out all the others) or
                which ones we want to <dfn>exclude</dfn> (keeping the rest). TEI ODD XML can
                also express specific customizations, to lay out which attribute values you want to
                use in your project customization for, say, the attribute <code>xml:id</code> on the
                    <code>handNote</code> element.</p>

                    href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/blob/master/Class-Examples/TEI-ODD-Examples/Hamilton_ODD/hamiltonODD.odd"
                    >Here I have linked an example of an ODD customization</a> made by students working on <a
                    href="https://hamilton.newtfire.org">a project to encode Hamilton the
                    Musical</a>, with lots of customized attribute values mostly for providing
                distinct identifiers for characters in the musical. Since we are working with
                manuscripts and other kinds of materials, our ODD customizations will certainly look different from this: we will
                need to work with different modules, but we will still want to <em>customize</em> them as we see
                in the ODD file, to determine which elements we ware going to use and to indicate what values
                we want to work with on some of the attributes.</p>
            
            
           
            <!--I am adding a couple of more images from that set for this assignment to
                give us a little more to work with (specifically, examples of when Mary Behrend
                quotes some poetry that we might want to reference as a cited quote using TEI). The
                goal, as before, is not to encode the entire set in these homework assignments, but
                at least to encode a new page that you had not included before, to study the pages
                thinking about their structure and content, do some research in <a
                    href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">the TEI
                    Guidelines</a> about how to encode with TEI. Only this time, our goal is also to
                produce a customization of the TEI that will streamline our work for coding this set
                of documents.</p>

        <section title="ODD-customization">
            <p>To explore how to create an ODD, let's work with your markup of either the calendar sheets or the Irvin Kochel letter you have been marking in TEI. You may also consult <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/tree/master/Class-Examples/TEI">our class examples for TEI posted in the textEncoding-Hub</a>. </p>
            <p>A good place to begin work on an ODD customizations is a tool designed for TEI called
                Roma Beta, available at <a href="https://romabeta.tei-c.org/"
                    >https://romabeta.tei-c.org/</a>. This is where we created our starter ODD for
                class, which I downloaded and <a
                    href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/tree/master/Class-Examples/TEI-ODD-Examples/Mary-Behrend-Calendar-Starter-ODD"
                    >pushed to our textEncoding-Hub repo, and stored in Class Examples >>
                    TEI-ODD-Examples</a>. For this exercise, you may begin with this ODD file and
                continue to customize it, or you may start from scratch exploring how to include and
                exclude elements in Roma Beta. My assignment for you is simply to refine what we
                started, to try the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Upload our customized ODD from class to the Roma Beta tool (or if you wish to
                    experiment more, try starting from scratch working with TEI All or one of the
                    other customizations available).</li>
                <li>Try viewing the elements by module in TEI Roma so they are grouped together
                    helpfully (rather than viewing them all in alphabetical order).</li>
                <li>Try adding or removing one or more elements from the customization (so long as
                    this makes sense based on your coding of the calendar sheets). </li>
                <li>Work on modifying an element to customize its attribute values, or even remove
                    some attributes you probably will not use. Click through the menus to see how to
                    edit attributes and values on an element. <em>Suggestion:</em> work on the
                        <code>handNote</code> element to customize the attributes on it, and give
                    them specific values. </li>
                <li>Continue <q>looking stuff up</q> in the TEI Guidelines, that is Googling for
                        <q>TEI P5 whateverYouLookFor</q> to see Element Spec pages and examples of
                    how these are used in TEI projects.</li>
                <li>Now, download your ODD and save it with your homework files. In Roma Beta, use
                    the <strong>first</strong> download option: <code>Customization as ODD</code>. </li>
                <li>Open your ODD in the oXygen XML Editor (it should be clear and legible to read
                    as an XML file). Make edits to the top of it to change its name and the
                    descriptive contents as you wish.</li>
                <li>Apply the wrench tool to set up an ODD transformation: select the following
                    settings (as shown in the screen capture): <ol>
                        <li>TEI ODD XHTML</li>
                        <li>TEI ODD to RELAX NG XML</li>
                    </ol>
                    <img src="../tutorials/TEI-images/ODD-customize-settings.png" width="600" />
                </li>
                <li>View the HTML documentation in a web browser and see the list of elements you
                    have customized for the project</li>
                <li>The Relax NG you can associate with your XML file is saved in a directory named
                        <code>out/</code> just below the ODD and the ODD XHTML file. Your next task
                    is to associate that schema with your XML file for the calendar and see if your
                    code is valid to the schema. If it is not, try to amend your coding to work with
                    the ODD schema, or update the ODD (using Roma or the ODD file in oXygen) to
                    generate an improved schema. </li>
                <li><strong>What to submit on Canvas:</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your ODD file saved with <code>.odd</code> extension</li>
                        <li>The ODD HTML documentation file (as output with a <code>.html</code>
                            extension). </li>
                        <li>Your TEI file for the calendar pages saved with the schema associated
                            (with <code>.xml</code> extension). Add XML comments to this if you are
                            having trouble getting the ODD schema to validate your XML.</li>

                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
