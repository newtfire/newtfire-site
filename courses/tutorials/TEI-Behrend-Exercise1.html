        <section title="objectives">
            <h3>Introducing the TEI with the Behrends</h3>
            <p>This is the first of a series of homework assignments to introduce you to the XML-based language of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). We will be working with a sampling of documents curated at the Penn State Behrend College library just to get started. Specifically, they are a series of calendar sheets from the year 1909 on which Mary Behrend (who called herself <q>Molly</q>), drew pictures and wrote notes to her husband Ernst Behrend. We will work with a sampling of these images to get us started on learning how TEI can help us model the data on documents.</p>
            <p>We are not displaying the complete series of calendar sheets here, but just enough to get started looking at them and thinking about the questions they raise. Who were the people mentioned or written to on these sheets? What can we tell about their lives? What motivated the drawings and messages on these sheets in the early months of 1909?</p>

<p>The archivist and I found these calendar sheets (and many more from 1909) inside a baby album showing pictures of the Behrend children, one of whom. Moritz Warren Behrend, was born in 1909. Here is a picture of the album.</p>

            <p>You may have ideas on how you could model these documents in your own XML, but our goal with this assignment is to learn about the TEI, which provides a shared international language for encoding culturally significant documents to represent their meaningful content. <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">The TEI Guidelines</a> are a large reference guide and also a schema for working with a <em>controlled vocabulary</em> in XML, so working with the TEI means doing a lot of looking up code in the Guidelines to see what best fits a project we are working on. It also means working with a new kind of file format that we can open in the oXygen XML Editor. oXygen also gives us guidance with what code is <em>valid</em> in TEI, and when we work with the TEI in oXygen, it can provide little windows into the Guidelines definitions for elements as well as steer us toward appropriate attributes. You will need to be reading and researching the Guidelines to gain experience with the TEI. So, that is what we will begin doing with this assignment.</p>
            
           
            <p>Our objectives are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study this selection of Mary Behrend’s 1909 calendar sheets to observe what kinds of data and metadata they hold.</li>
                <li>Research the Guidelines seeking elements and attributes to apply if you were going to markup the full collection of calendar sheets completely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For this first exercise, you do <em>not</em> need to completely mark up all the sheets I am whowing here in my photos. Instead, you will research the TEI Guidelines to see what elements and attributes will help you to model these documents in a TEI file.</p>
        </section>
        <section title="resources">
            <h3>How to begin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It will help to learn more about the Behrends and especially Mary Behrend. Start by reading this <a href="https://behrendblog.com/2014/03/03/women-in-history-month-meet-mary-behrend/">background information on the Behrend Blog from 2014</a>. </li>
                <li>Then come back here and study the photos of calendar sheets I've posted on this assignment. Take notes on what you're seeing: the form of the pages, the different kinds of printing and handwriting and drawing, the different inks for writing. What features could you be capturing in markup that models these documents?</li>
                <li>Now, begin researching <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">the TEI Guidelines</a> to find relevant sections for coding the survey. Specifically, take notes on what markup from the TEI you think would be helpful from the following resources in the Guidelines:
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONAen/html/">Chapter 3: Elements Available in All TEI Documents</a>: Use the Table of Contents to help you find specific kinds of things, like say, graphics! (Definitely not everything will be relevant in this chapter, but some things will be very helpful.)</li>
                    <li><a href="http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/DS.html">Chapter 4: Default Text Structure</a>: Look at this chapter to think about how to organize in one TEI file a document in multiple sheets with dates on it.  What code makes sense to apply from this chapter?</li>
                    <li>How would you encode the handwriting on these pages as distinct from, yet connected to the printed parts of the calendar sheets? This chapter may help: <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html">Chapter 10: Manuscript Description</a>. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Try looking in the <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#msph">section on Physical Description</a> </li>
                            <li>and continue with the following sections through Hand Descriptions and <a href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/MS.html#msphwr">10.7.2.1 (Writing)</a> (which has some information on representing typescript, too.) </li>
                            
                        </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
   
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Time to write your first TEI!</h3>
            <p>Let’s see what it’s like to write some TEI after you have done a bit of research on TEI document structures and the elements you would like to try.</p>
            <p>Open new TEI document in the oXygen XML Editor. Do this by going to File >> New, and typing in TEI to bring up many options for TEI documents. Look for the 
                folder <strong>TEI</strong> or <strong>TEI P5</strong>, and select <strong>All</strong> (the first entry inside it), as I'm showing in my screen capture: </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="TEI-images/tei-all-oxygen.png" alt="selecting TEI ALL in oXygen XML Editor"/>
            </figure>
            <p>TEI All includes the entire TEI schema, so it will let us explore our options for modeling documents as we are getting started.
                Notice when you open a TEI All document in oXygen, you will see it has two big outer elements (children of the root element <code>TEI</code>), the <code>teiHeader</code> and <code>text</code>.</p>
           <p> The <code>teiHeader</code> holds metadata about the document, including who is editing it, where the physical document is found, and much more. We will concentrate on 
                encoding the <code>teiHeader</code> in a later homework assignment.</p>
            <p>For this exercise, we can concentrate on the <code>text</code> element which, in TEI, is where we model the contents of the document and the information it is sharing with us. You do not need to fully represent a transcription of every calendar sheet here, but instead, see if you can block out some valid TEI in the <code>text</code> that can represent a series of calendar sheets. See if you can represent as much of the contents of one or two calendar sheets here following a system you come up with in your exploration of the TEI. There will be a number of different ways you can adapt the TEI for this challenge, so many approaches are valid, and we will be interested in comparing notes when we look at the code you submitted together in Monday’s class. </p>
            <p>Submit your TEI file (saved with a <code>.xml</code> file extension) on Canvas at this upload point for this assignment.</p>

            <h3>Plotting strategy: Identify markup from the TEI to use</h3>
            <p>TEI projects are best begun with a round of debate and discussion and comparing notes, so in that spirit, complete this first TEI exercise by writing a post on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/issues/19">our textEncoding-Hub Issue for this assignment</a>. In the post, describe what you think is important to mark in the survey, and link to passages in the TEI Guidelines defining elements and attributes that we should use in this project. You may comment on how you would want to approach the markup of the survey and the handwriting whether or not you find good matches for what you wish to do in the TEI Guidelines. Raise questions and respond to each other about passages in the Guidelines that you are not certain about but seem relevant to our task. </p>
         <p>Continue after our next class <a href="TEI-AJC-Exercise2.html">TEI Exercise 2</a>, when we begin experimenting with writing TEI code.</p>
