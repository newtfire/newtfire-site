        <section title="objectives">
            <h3>Introducing the TEI with the Behrends</h3>
            <p>This is the first of a series of homework assignments to introduce you to the
                XML-based language of the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI). We will be working with a
                sampling of documents curated at the Penn State Behrend College library just to get
                started. Specifically, they are a series of calendar sheets from the year 1909 on
                which Mary Behrend (who called herself <q>Molly</q>), drew pictures and wrote notes
                to her husband Ernst Behrend. We will work with a sampling of these images to get us
                started on learning how TEI can help us model the data on documents.</p>
            <p>We are not displaying the complete series of calendar sheets here, but just enough to
                get started looking at them and thinking about the questions they raise. Can you
                read some of the drawings and messages on these sheets?</p>

            <p>The archivist and I found these calendar sheets (and many more from 1909) inside a
                family album showing pictures of the Behrend children, one of whom. Moritz Warren
                Behrend, was born in 1909. Here is a picture of the album.</p>

            <p>Our goal with this assignment is to learn about the TEI, which provides a shared
                international language for encoding culturally significant documents to represent
                their meaningful content. <a
                    href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">The TEI
                    Guidelines</a> are a large reference guide and also a schema for working with a
                    <em>controlled vocabulary</em> in XML, so working with the TEI means doing a lot
                of looking up code in the Guidelines to see what best fits a project we are working
                on. Sometimes this is not as convenient as making up your own XML markup system, but
                sometimes you can learn from the community that developed the Guidelines to observe
                things about documents that you may not have thought of coding before.</p>
            <p>You will need to be reading and researching the Guidelines to code with the TEI. So,
                that is what we will begin doing with this assignment. Coding in TEI also means
                working with a new kind of file format that we can open in the oXygen XML Editor.
                oXygen gives us guidance with what code is <em>valid</em> in TEI, and when we work
                with the TEI in oXygen, it can suggest attributes to put on a TEI element and
                provide little pop-up windows into the Guidelines to explain how an element may be
                used. </p>

            <p>Our objectives are to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Study this selection of Mary Behrend’s 1909 calendar sheets to observe what
                    kinds of data and metadata they hold.</li>
                <li>Research the Guidelines seeking elements and attributes to apply if you were
                    going to markup the full collection of calendar sheets completely.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For this first exercise, you do <em>not</em> need to completely mark up all the
                sheets I am showing here in my photos. Instead, you will research the TEI Guidelines
                to see what elements and attributes will help you to model these documents in a TEI
                file.</p>

            <h3>How to begin</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>It will help to learn more about the Behrends and especially Mary Behrend. Start
                    by reading this <a
                        href="https://behrendblog.com/2014/03/03/women-in-history-month-meet-mary-behrend/"
                        >background information on the Behrend Blog from 2014</a>. </li>
                <li>Then come back here and study the photos of calendar sheets I've posted on this
                    assignment. Take notes on what you're seeing: the form of the pages, the
                    different kinds of printing and handwriting and drawing, the different inks for
                    writing. What features could you be capturing in markup that models these
                    documents?</li>
                <li>Now, begin researching <a
                        href="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/index.html">the TEI
                        Guidelines</a> to find relevant sections for coding the documents.
                    Specifically, take notes on what markup from the TEI you think would be helpful
                    from the following resources in the Guidelines: <ul>
                        <li><a
                                href="https://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CO.html#CONAen/html/"
                                >Chapter 3: Elements Available in All TEI Documents</a>: Use the
                            Table of Contents to help you find specific kinds of things, like say,
                            graphics! (Definitely not everything will be relevant in this chapter,
                            but some things will be very helpful.)</li>

                            think about how to organize in one TEI file a document in multiple
                            sheets with dates on it. What code makes sense to apply from this
                            chapter?</li>
                        <li>How would you encode the handwriting on these pages as distinct from,
                            yet connected to the printed parts of the calendar sheets? This chapter
                            may help: <a

            <h3>Try coding some TEI</h3>


            <p> Choose two or three calendar sheets at most to focus on for this exercise. 
                The handwriting on these pages is difficult to read, so do not attempt to transcribe
                (copy) it all out in this homework! 
                You may find it easier to describe the artwork.
                <strong>Try to identify the different parts of the page:</strong> picture, different colors of
                handwriting, printed text from the calendar. Can you find some TEI elements to store
                information about these different features on the pages? <strong>See if you can represent
                some of the contents or some metadata from one or two calendar sheets using TEI
                markup.</strong></p>
            <p>Open new TEI document in the oXygen XML Editor. Do this by going to File >> New, and
                typing in TEI to bring up many options for TEI documents. Look for the folder
                    <strong>TEI</strong> or <strong>TEI P5</strong>, and select <strong>All</strong>
                (the first entry inside it), as I'm showing in my screen capture: </p>
            <figure class="mbtei">
                <img src="TEI-images/tei-all-oxygen.png"
                    alt="selecting TEI ALL in oXygen XML Editor" />
            </figure>
            <p>TEI All includes the entire TEI schema, so it will let us explore our options for
                modeling documents as we are getting started. Notice when you open a TEI All
                document in oXygen, you will see it has two big outer elements (children of the root
                element <code>TEI</code>), the <code>teiHeader</code> and <code>text</code>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>teiHeader</code> holds metadata, including a descriptive title, who
                    created the original documents (Mary Behrend), who is preparing the digital code
                    in TEI (that's you), where the original source document can be found,
                    information about the materials used to create the source, and more.</li>
                <li>The <code>text</code> element in TEI is where we represent the contents of the
                    documents in meaningful markup.</li>
                <li><strong>Google TEI P5 yourElement</strong> (e.g. Google for TEI P5 sourceDesc) to quickly find TEI a element's <q>specs page</q>.  
                    This helpful page posts an element’s definition, shows examples of use, and indicates what attributes it takes, how it nests (what elements contain it), and what elements are allowed inside.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You may have trouble setting elements you want to use in the TEI in a way that
                doesn't raise an error. If that happens, try to see what is causing the error, and
                explain what you're trying to do in an XML comment. There will be a number of
                different ways to adapt the TEI for , so we will be interested in comparing notes
                when we look at the code you submitted together in Monday’s class. Submit your TEI
                file (saved with a <code>.xml</code> file extension) on Canvas at this upload point
                for this assignment.</p>

            <h3>Plotting strategy: Identify markup from the TEI to use</h3>
            <p>TEI projects are best begun with a round of debate and discussion and comparing notes, so in that spirit, complete this first TEI exercise by writing a post on <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/issues/19">our textEncoding-Hub Issue for this assignment</a>. In the post, describe what you think is important to mark in the survey, and link to passages in the TEI Guidelines defining elements and attributes that we should use in this project. You may comment on how you would want to approach the markup of the survey and the handwriting whether or not you find good matches for what you wish to do in the TEI Guidelines. Raise questions and respond to each other about passages in the Guidelines that you are not certain about but seem relevant to our task. </p>
