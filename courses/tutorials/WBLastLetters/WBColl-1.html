                  <br/><span class="lineNum">23</span>  the girl who made the date knows
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">24</span>  about me is that I am 5'8" tall.

                  <span class="lineNum">25</span>  Tomorrow we have 20 minute
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">26</span>  periods and are all through at
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">27</span>  11.30. As I have no classesthe 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">28</span>  sixth and seventh periods I shall
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">29</span>  be all through at 10.50. This works
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">30</span>  out very well, because Mr.Oatley
                  
                  
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">31</span>  is leaving at eleven o'clock for
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">32</span>  Springfield in his car. He is going
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">33</span>  to take us unknown along and so that
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">34</span>  gives us plenty of time to get the one
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">35</span>  o'clock out of Springfield. That
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">36</span>  gives Ned a chance to stay off in
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">37</span>  New Haven and gives me a chance
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">38</span>  to see Harriet.

                  <br/><span class="lineNum">41</span>  be mighty nice to have the whole family

               <h2>Speech prepared by P. J. Long for a memorial service for Warren Behrend, after 1930</h2>
               
               
               
               
               
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">1</span>  On December 19th, 1929 Warren Behrend on his way to join his family 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">2</span>  for the christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">3</span>  turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">4</span>  man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">5</span>  children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">6</span>  in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">7</span>  fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">8</span>  an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">9</span>  some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">10</span>  have suffered with him.
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">11</span>  it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">12</span>  community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">13</span>  Warren's deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">14</span>  every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">15</span>  andof unselfish service. This deed should, and i confidently trust, will be 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">16</span>  an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">17</span>  duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">18</span>  As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">19</span>  unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">20</span>  in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">21</span>  these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">22</span>  and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure Warren's heroic deed enacted in our
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">23</span>  midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">24</span>  others rather than to ourselves.

               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">25</span>  This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">26</span>  more particularly the children whose lives were saved by warren Behrend's heroism,
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">27</span>  with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">28</span>  life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">29</span>  career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">30</span>  though the children themselves were unkown to him.
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">31</span>  If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">32</span>  boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">33</span>  sparing yourselves but givingg youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">34</span>  calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have 
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">35</span>  been in vein.
                  </p>
               
               <p>
                  <span class="lineNum">36</span>  From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">37</span>  would wish nothing better tan that these children spared by his heroic
                  <br/><span class="lineNum">38</span>  decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.
