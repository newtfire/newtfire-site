        <p n="1">
            <ln n="1"/>On December 19th, 1929 Warren Behrend on his way to join his family 
            <ln n="2"/>for the christmas holiday met a school bus at this place. The bus Made a left
            <ln n="3"/>turn in front of his car without giving the proper signal. Instantly this 
            <ln n="4"/>man decided to run his car off the road bed, though it was slippery, to save these
            <ln n="5"/>children. his car overturned in this effort, killing him instantly 
        </p>
        <p n="2">
            <ln n="1"/>in my experience, I have never known a finer example of self forget-
            <ln n="2"/>fulness, esteeming the safety of others before oneself. Had he hesitated but
            <ln n="3"/>an instant the tragedy of that fatal day would have been written in deeper lines
            <ln n="4"/>some who are here today in possession of youthful health would almost certainly
            <ln n="5"/>have suffered with him.
        </p>
        <p n="3">
            <ln n="1"/>it is appropriate to this occasion that young people of this
            <ln n="2"/>community pause today to consider his wonderful example of heroic sacrifice.
            <ln n="3"/>Warren's deed is a compelling challenge to every one present, most definitely to 
            <ln n="4"/>every boy and girl in this community to dedicate ourselves to the call of duty 
            <ln n="5"/>andof unselfish service. This deed should, and i confidently trust, will be 
            <ln n="6"/>an inspiration to succeeding generations to respond instantly to the call to
            <ln n="7"/>duty even though it may mean to sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p n="4">
            <ln n="1"/>As you young people look out into the world today the call to 
            <ln n="2"/>unselfish service was never so compelling. Many of the finer things of life are 
            <ln n="3"/>in peril. It is confused, almost hysterical. There is no remedy on earth for 
            <ln n="4"/>these disorders so effectual as deeds not words of kindess, of self forgetfulness,
            <ln n="5"/>and unselfish sacrifice. May we not treasure Warren's heroic deed enacted in our
            <ln n="6"/>midst as a reminder to all future generations that the highest duty is always to 
            <ln n="7"/>others rather than to ourselves.
        </p>
        <p n="5">
            <ln n="1"/>This community, the two schools in this immediate neighborhood and 
            <ln n="2"/>more particularly the children whose lives were saved by warren Behrend's heroism,
            <ln n="3"/>with their parents and friends come today to pay respectful tribute to his wonderful

            <ln n="4"/>life crowded as it was with all the rich promise of a most useful and happy
            <ln n="5"/>career, then suddenly ccrowned by sacrificing all to the safety of children,
            <ln n="6"/>though the children themselves were unkown to him.
        </p>
        <p n="6">
            <ln n="1"/>If inspired by the sacrifice of this splendid young man, you
            <ln n="2"/>boys and girls will dedicate your lives to the great tasks of life, not
            <ln n="3"/>sparing yourselves but givingg youselves instantly and cheerfully when duty 
            <ln n="4"/>calls, then the beautiful example of this splendid young man will not have 
            <ln n="5"/>been in vein.
        </p>
        <p n="7">
            <ln n="1"/>From what we learn of his exalted character we think that we
            <ln n="2"/>would wish nothing better tan that these children spared by his heroic
            <ln n="3"/>decision should contribute something worth while to make the world better.
