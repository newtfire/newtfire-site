            <h2>Big picture</h2>
            <p>This series of assignments is part of our class’s collaboration with the Digital
                John Norton team at University of Guelph. You are working with a
                photo facsimile of a manuscript letter and a transcription prepared in Microsoft Word by
                the Guelph team.</p>
            <section title="workflow" id="workflow">
                <h3>How to work on these exercises</h3>
                <p>This series involves studying the handwritten manuscripts
                    and comparing them with the transcriptions in Word. You should probably copy the Word transcription
                    into the oXygen XML Editor, and change it into XML there. While you are doing this, you will 
                    need to be looking at a PDF viewer or a web browser to display photo facsimiles of Norton Teyoninhokarawen’s
                    handwritten letters.</p>
                <h4>Suggestions to make this easier</h4>
                <p>Think about your workspace and how you move between applications.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You could try to organize the applications your screen so the
                        code editor is open for one half of it.</li>
                    <li>Possibly more helpful: Can you access a second monitor or look at the Norton
                        manuscript on a second screen (maybe a tablet or phone)?</li>
                    <li>You could log in to a machine in a campus computer lab,
                        clone the textEncoding-Hub and open the photofacsimile page on a big monitor to look at
                        while you do your coding on a different machine. (You can be logged in to two computers in a lab at the same time.) 
                        <ul>
                            <li>Optional: If this seems appealing, try setting up your GitHub access and cloning your digit110 repository in the Q Drive on one of the Digit lab computers.
                            You will be turning the XML files in over Canvas to help us review them quickly, but you may also want to practice your GitHub skills by moving in to the Q drive.</li>
                        </ul>

            <h2>Exercise 1</h2>
            <p>Choose one of the following letters to work with, taking a look at both the text
                and the transcription that we have available. Your task is to create an XML document that
                represents as much as possible what you can see/understand from the manuscript photo facsimiles.</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Option A:</strong> Pages 1 and 2 of a long letter written on March 9, 1804.

                        you are curious or want to figure out where the "extra" passage of text might fit in Norton's writing process.</li>

              <h3>How to do this assignment</h3>
              <p>Take this work in stages:</p>
              <ul>
                  <li>You can start your XML code by copying in the transcription, but take your time
                      and read the text slowly comparing it with what you see in the photos.</li>
                  <li>Develop your
                      markup to encode the structure of the document, the meaningful information about the structure of the letter
                      (the paragraphs, and if you have it, a dateline showing when and where Norton was writing, and 
                      the parts where he signs off and closes the letter).</li>
                  <li>Try marking information like places, people, interesting objects (etc.) What seems
                      interesting to track with markup?</li>
                  <li><strong>Here's the challenge:</strong> Find things that you can see in the manuscript but are not represented 
                      in the transcription. There will be a lot of this: you may not be able to read some of it, but try to
                      find a way to represent these <strong>textual events</strong> (like deletions and insertions) in your markup.</li>
                  <li>Don’t worry if you don't finish everything you want to encode! This is just a first stage homework, and you will be continuing in a next step
                  after learning more about Norton.</li>
              </ul>
 
          <p>This is an introductory assignment and you do not have time to perfectly mark everything! 
            Just try to capture something of what you can see, and submit it before class so we can discuss how you approached
            the markup! The goal here is to come up with a *system* for marking up what you see in the photofacsimiles more than totally completing the work!</p>

            <h2>Exercise 2</h2>
            <p>After class discussion of your submissions for Exercise 1, and after hearing Dr. Paul Barrett’s guest lecture to the class about 
                John Norton Teyoninhokarawen and his writings, come back to your encoding and try something new based on what you have learned. </p>
               <ul> <li>You could continue encoding in the same file and work with the same material: try to encode more features of the document you started with.</li>
                <li>Or, you could choose one of the other options and start a fresh encoding, but make this approach to your code different based on what you have learned.</li>
              <li>  You could investigate more information about something mentioned in the letter and add that new informattion to enrich your markup.</li>
                <li>Add XML comments to your code to comment on how you changed your approach from the first exercise to this one. </li>
