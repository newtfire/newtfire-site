            <h3>Before you begin</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment, you should prepare your workspace: Where do you
                want to do your coding homework this semester? You will be doing most of your coding
                work for this course in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor. This is installed in the
                campus computer labs, and you may also install it on any other computer(s) you plan
                to work with this semester. Also, before beginning homework assignments, you need to
                read the related tutorials we have posted (plus notes you took in class) and keep
                these open and handy to consult as you are working. For the very first assignment,
                here is what you will need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software on your own computer(s) Follow the <a
                        href="http://canvas.psu.edu">instructions and apply the license key we have
                        posted on Canvas</a>.</li>
                <li>Read our <a href="explainXML.html"><q>Introduction to XML</q></a></li>
                <li>Read <a href="explainFileNames.html"><q>File Conventions for Canvas
                            Assignments</q></a>, so you will know how to name this and most other
                    homework files you submit on Canvas.</li>

            <h3>Try coding a poem in XML</h3>
            <p>To get started with XML coding, and working wtih a <q>tree</q> structure for modeling
                a document, start by coding a poem (which we absolutely chose because it is about
                trees and leaves). Our source document for this assignment is <a
                    href="https://poets.org/poem/leaves-0">the poem <q>Leaves</q> by Lloyd
                    Schwartz</a> as posted on poets.org. </p>


            <h3>Coding the poem in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First, highlight and copy the text of the document that is relevant for
                    representing the poem.</li>

                <li>Open a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Click on the icon at top left that
                    looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner (or go to File and New...),
                    type <code>XML</code> in the filter window, and click the <code>Create</code>
                    button to launch a new XML document.</li>
                <li>Paste in the text you intend to mark up, and begin marking it
                        <dfn>elements</dfn> and add <dfn>attributes</dfn>. Remember to wrap a <strong>root element</strong> to wrap the entire document and create
                a well-formed tree structure.</li>
                <li>Try highlighting text that you want to tag, and using CTRL + E (Windows) or Command +
                    E (Mac) to fill in a tag name. The oXygen editor will then insert the start and the
                    end tag of an element where you want to wrap it around some text.</li>
                <li>Remember that line breaks in the text <em>are not preserved in XML</em>. Mark up the
                    structure of the document accordingly! Use the <q>Format and Indent</q> button
                    (which we call <q>pretty print</q> feature in oXygen to look at the structure you
                    are creating. Here is a screen capture showing you where to find the <q>Format and
                        Indent</q> button. (Note: I have set up my oXygen Editor in dark mode, so your colors will likely look a little different than my image.)
                    <img src="oxygen-prettyprint.png" class="screenCap" alt="the oXygen XML Editor's pretty-print button"/></li>
            
                <li>Tips: Watch the color of the square in the upper right corner: if it is green,
                    your code is well-formed, but if it turns <q>angry red</q>, you will know there
                    is an error, perhaps <dfn>tangled tags</dfn> or a missing angle bracket, or a
                    missing <dfn>root element</dfn>. Notice how &lt;oXygen/&gt; generates a closing
                    tag every time you type your own start tag. One handy trick is to you use your
                    mouse to highlight text you want to wrap in an element, and use Control+E in
                    Windows (or Command+E on a Mac) to bring up a window to enter an element name.
                    (You have to add the attributes after you set an element name.)</li>
                <li>Save your work frequently, and name your file using our <a
                        href="explainFileNames.html">standard form for homework names</a>.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Challenges and suggestions for this assignment</h3>
            <p>There is no single way to do this exercise, but I want you to think about how you
                nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the relationship between
                elements and attributes in XML.</p>
            <ul>
                
                <li>Avoid coding element and attributes that just copy the same words and phrases in
                    the text. Think of categories and standard units, or simple identifiers you can
                    supply so that your markup <em>adds new value</em> to the text. </li>
                <li>How will you name your elements and attributes?  Imagine <em>repeating</em> whatever element and attribute names you use, if
                    you were coding several poems like this one in a project. Think about how to keep the coding
                    manageable and not too complicated for others to continue.</li>
                <li>In poems, the way words are organized in lines, and in groups of lines is meaningful, in a way that they are not in paragraphs. Your markup should capture the line and line-group structure.
                Try creating a nested structure with your markup to hold groups of lines together.
                </li>
                <li>What kinds of information or metadata could you store about the lines in attributes? For example, when the lines are indented, could you apply an attribute to hold information about meaningful formatting on the screen, even if that doesn't 
                    literally <q>work</q> when you pretty-print the document in oXygen?</li>
                <li>Try some markup of interesting images / concepts inside the lines. There's so much you <em>could</em> mark here, and we encourage you to do that <em>efficiently</em>! Short element names are easiest to type and can capture important categories, instead of re-using the words in the poem.
                    
               <em>Try to keep this under control!</em>: apply just a few general element names (like, two or three at most) that you could use for related kinds of patterns instaed of trying to give a new name to each one.
                Can you use attributes to help categorize a few interesting features of the poem?
                </li>
                
                <li>Try applying a little markup to <em>annotate</em>, or include your own notes on something in the poem. Consider adding elements (perhaps a note with your own text inside) to annotate
                    the document or store some extra contextual information about the words and phrases. 
                    How could you write markup to clearly distinguish your voice from the
                    poem? (Hint: attributes can help with this: you could indicate yourself with your initials as a value.)</li>
            </ul>
