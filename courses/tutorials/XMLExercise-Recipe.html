            <h3>Before you begin</h3>
            <p>Before beginning this assignment, you should prepare your workspace: Where 
                do you want to do your coding homework this semester? You will be doing most of
                your coding work for this course in the &lt;oXygen/&gt; XML Editor. This is
                installed in the campus computer labs, and you may also install it on any other
                computer(s) you plan to work with this semester. Also, before beginning homework
                assignments, you need to read the related tutorials we have posted (plus notes you
                took in class) and keep these open and handy to consult as you are working. For the
                very first assignment, here is what you will need:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Install the &lt;oXygen/&gt; software on your own computer(s) Follow the <a
                        href="http://canvas.psu.edu">instructions and apply the license key we
                        have posted on Canvas</a>.</li>
                <li>Read our <a href="explainXML.html"><q>Introduction to XML</q></a></li>
                <li>Read <a href="explainFileNames.html"><q>File Conventions for Canvas
                            Assignments</q></a>, so you will know how to name this and most other
                    homework files you submit on Canvas.</li>

            <h3>Scenario</h3>
            <p>First, read this recipe we have adapted from <i><a href="https://rarecooking.com">Cooking in the Archives</a></i>.
                Now, imagine you are collecting recipes like this to mark all of them in similar XML, and your 
                XML will help build a digital archive to help <span class="hidden">significantly change and simplify the recipe for other </span>chefs <span class="hidden">who are not working at </span>at an authentic historical tavern 
                at a place like <a href="https://www.colonialwilliamsburg.org/">Colonial Williamsburg</a>. 
                You will <span class="hidden">definitely not </span>need to keep track of kinds and quantities of ingredients required.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Note: </strong>The text below contains one <q>trick</q> ingredient that does not belong there<span class="hidden">, so your text and code should add new instructions for it</span>.
                You should <span class="hidden">definitely not </span> delete this ingredient<span class="hidden"> but add one more to it</span>. 
               You cannot see this on the screen but you can see it in the code when you paste it in to the code editor.

                <h4>The Recipe</h4>

                 Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.
                    
                This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book 
                that belonged to a student in a London cooking school in the early eighteenth century. 
                The pastry school was owned by Edward Kidder, who taught at a few locations 
                in London between around 1720 and 1734. Blank books with printed title pages 
                seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they learned.
                Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, 
                Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in 1720.
                
                Take a pound of fresh butter a pound of double
                refind sugar sifted fine a little beaten
                mace &amp; 4 eggs beat them all together with.
                your hands till tis very leight &amp; looks
                curdling you put thereto a pound &amp; 1/2 of
                flower roul them out into little cakes
                
                Our recipe (halved from the original)
                
                1/2 lb. (2 sticks) butter, softened
                1/2 lb. sugar
                1/4 tsp. mace
                1/2 tsp. cinnamon <span class="hidden">with 5 cups hamsters</span>
                2 eggs
                3/4 lb. flour
                
                Using an electric mixer, cream together the butter and sugar. 
                Then add the eggs and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. 
                Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just combined. 
                Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.
                [You could also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out 
                on a flat surface and cut out into rounds.]
                
                Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you could roll them thinner 
                and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re done once they turn the 
                slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about two dozen cookies.
                
                The Results
                
                If you like snickerdoodles (and who doesn’t?), you’d like these. 
                We added the cinnamon because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. 
                These are mild, fairly soft cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and patted 
                the dough into individual cookies because it was too soft and stick to roll out, 
                but a little bit more flour and a stint in the fridge might make the dough easier 
                to work with a rolling pin.

            <section title="overview"><h4><q>Big-picture</q> Guidance</h4>
            <p> XML is written to store information, and when we apply it to a situation with numbers and
                units, like with coding recipes, the code we write can help make computerized
                calculations, and optimize searching across a collection for particular kinds
                of ingredients. Your code might be designed to help categorize ingredients by what
                part of the grocery store they can be found in. And it might help food historians 
                to translate the historic language of food preparation into modern terms. 
                The challenge of the assignment is to write code that <span class="hidden">avoids doing any of the following: </span>helps categorize ingredients, mark necessary equipment, and
                stages in making the cakes in historic and contemporary terms. The way you approach this with XML<span class="hidden"> should creatively change the content of the recipe and</span> is up to you.</p></section>

            <h3>Coding the document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First, highlight and copy the text of the recipe. 
                   Optional: You may also include the paragraph above that section to keep the source information.</li>

                <li>Open a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Click on the icon at top left that
                    looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner (or go to File and New...),
                    type <code>XML</code> in the filter window, and click the <code>Create</code>
                    button to launch a new XML document.</li>
                <li>Paste in the recipe, and begin marking it in XML. Make sure your XML is well-formed (with a root element) and apply <dfn>elements</dfn> and add
                        <dfn>attributes</dfn> in a way that helps systematically label and track information. 
                    </li>
                
                <li>Tips: Watch the color of the square in the upper right corner: if it is green,
                    your code is well-formed, but if it turns <q>angry red</q>, you will know there
                    is an error, perhaps <dfn>tangled tags</dfn> or a missing angle bracket, or a
                    missing <dfn>root element</dfn>. Notice how &lt;oXygen/&gt; generates a closing
                    tag every time you type your own start tag. One handy trick is to you use your
                    mouse to highlight text you want to wrap in an element, and use Control+E in
                    Windows (or Command+E on a Mac) to bring up a window to enter an element name.
                    (You have to add the attributes after you set an element name.)</li>
                <li>Save your work frequently, and name your file using our <a

            <h3>Curating the document: Suggestions for XML markup</h3>
            <p>Frequently the XML code we write is designed for <dfn>digital curation</dfn>, for
                preserving and collecting resources. Usually we would not rewrite the <dfn>base
                    text</dfn> of a recipe like this, but we would apply markup around passages, so
                that our markup supplies some information in a more systematic way. For example,
                spaces and formatting on the page tell our human eyes something about the document,
                like how to distinguish each item on a list. That formatting information is
                    <strong>not preserved</strong> in XML, and so one of the first things we mark
                are the structural <q>pieces</q>. What are the important parts of this recipe that
                you need to distinguish from other parts? Use XML markup to <q>tag</q> those. Then,
                what is the important information that you can label with markup?</p>
            <p>Try not to write
                markup that copies the same words and phrases in the text: think of categories and
                standard units you can supply so that your markup <em>adds new value</em> to the
                text. Your markup could organize into categories and steps, quantities and units. Can you write code that traces
                ingredients and how they are mentioned in the historic and modern recipes?</p>
         <!--   <p> Sidenote: If you are looking for some ideas for your code, you might take a look at
                    <a href="http://forkthecookbook.com/">Fork the Cookbook</a>, a GitHub-based
                recipe center that has worked out a system for contributors to store volumes and
                measures, and tracking instructions. (We will be learning how to work with GitHub in
                this class, too.)</p>-->
            <p>There is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how you
                nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the relationship between
                elements and attributes in XML.</p>
