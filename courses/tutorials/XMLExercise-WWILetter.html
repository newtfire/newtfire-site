            <p>You are collecting letters and artifacts from World War I, and you encounter a
                collection of letters written by a woman who traveled as a volunteer nurse to
                France. You find the following as a print transcript. Your task is to code the 
                transcript in XML to mark important information. How you arrange the markup is up to you, but
                think of the code you apply as <em>the basis for coding many more letters written by
                    the same person</em>.</p>

[Letter from Marian Baldwin, June 30, 1917]

On Board La Touraine,

June 30th, 1917.

Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am actually off to France
and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the 
American Fund for French Wounded found an opening for me in Paris that I suppose I am still somewhat 
dazed and bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look ahead 
makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste in New York 
of the work that the A. F. F. W. is doing but its Headquarters in Paris will be different in some ways I fancy.

I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my age
are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on my great 
adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.

As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing alongside, 
I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds. How many 
of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one spoke much, 
and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after another appeared. 
I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in Lakewood and that your thoughts
and prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, 
after all.

We waited near the Statue of Liberty until midnight—a rumor had it that a "personage" was 
to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until we put to sea when it was given out 
that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was none other than the Italian Mission. 
Our spirits rose at once for, what with Frank Sayre on the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, 
we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two 
destroyers following us. They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, 
one on each side, and seem to be the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. 
A sailor informed me this morning that we weren't in much danger for the first four or five days 
but that after that I might see some excitement. Here's hoping!

I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of 
Haiti, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny stateroom, 
wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin cigarettes that 
smell like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for me but, as she says, 
luckily I am small, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my belongings! She really 
isn't bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and 
from that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the 
French since the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having lost some 
fingers off each hand. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his fingers.

            <h3>Coding the letter in &lt;oXygen/&gt;</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>First, highlight and copy the text in the box above.</li>

                <li>Open a new XML document in &lt;oXygen/&gt;. Click on the icon at top left that
                    looks like a piece of paper with a folded corner (or go to File and New...),
                    type <code>XML</code> in the filter window, and click the <code>Create</code>
                    button to launch a new XML document.</li>
                <li>Paste in the text you intend to mark up, and begin marking it to apply
                        <dfn>elements</dfn> and add <dfn>attributes</dfn>.</li>
                <li>Tips: <ul><li>Watch the color of the square in the upper right corner: if it is green,
                    your code is well-formed, but if it turns <q>angry red</q>, you will know there
                    is an error, perhaps <dfn>tangled tags</dfn> or a missing angle bracket, or a
                    missing <dfn>root element</dfn>.</li>
                    <li>Notice how &lt;oXygen/&gt; generates a closing
                    tag every time you type your own start tag.</li>
                    <li>Try using your mouse to highlight text you want to wrap in an element, and use Control+E in
                    Windows (or Command+E on a Mac) to bring up a window to enter an element name.
                    (You have to add the attributes after you set an element name.)</li></ul></li>
                <li>Save your work frequently, and name your file using our <a
                        href="explainFileNames.html">standard form for homework names</a>.</li>
            </ul>

        <section title="suggestions">
            <h3>Suggestions for XML markup</h3>
            <p>There is no single way to do this exercise, but we want you to think about how you
                nest levels of information (elements within elements), and the relationship between
                elements and attributes in XML.</p>
            <p>Frequently the XML code we write is designed for <dfn>digital curation</dfn>, for
                preserving and collecting resources. We would certainly not rewrite the <dfn>base
                    text</dfn> of a writer's personal correspondence, but we would apply markup
                    <em>around</em> passages, so that our markup supplies some information in a more
                systematic way. For example, spaces and formatting on the page tell our human eyes
                something about the document, like how to distinguish each item on a list. That
                formatting information is <strong>not preserved</strong> in XML, and so one of the
                first things we mark are the structural <q>pieces</q>. What are the important parts
                of this document that you need to distinguish from other parts? Use XML markup to
                    <q>tag</q> those. Then, what is the important information that you can label
                with markup?</p>
            <h4>Tips: </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Try not to code element and attributes that copy the same words and phrases in
                    the text. Think of how your markup can categorize or identify certain kinds of information, 
                    to <em>add new value</em> to the text. </li>
                <li>The structure of the document matters: Wrap elements around portions of the document (like the paragraphs, or the dateline) and give them simple, meaningful names. What is the stuff in square brackets at the start and end? Could you set an element to wrap around that material in place of the square brackets? </li>
                <li>Decide on elements and attribute names that you imagine <em>repeating</em> if
                    you were coding many letters in a project. Think about how to keep the coding
                    manageable and not too complicated for others to continue.</li>
                <li>Consider adding elements (perhaps a note with your own text inside) to annotate
                    the document or represent some of the contextual information available with the
                    text. How do you separate your voice, or others' voices from the original
                    letter-writer's voice?</li>
            </ul>
