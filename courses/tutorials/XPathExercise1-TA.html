      <h1><span class="banner">XPath Exercise 1: XPath on Hamlet</span></h1>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
     <ul> <li>Launch &lt;oXygen/&gt; editor, hit <strong>Ctrl+u (Windows)</strong> or <strong>Cmd+u (MacOS)</strong>, copy and paste the string <code>http://newtfire.org:8338/exist/apps/shakespeare/data/ham.xml</code>, and hit OK. (Backup copy at <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ebeshero/UpTransformation/master/data/ham.xml</code>.) This is a copy of Hamlet with TEI markup.</li>
        <li>Set the dropdown in the upper left to XPath 3.1 (if it is not set like this already). (This widget is called the <dfn>XPath Toolbar</dfn>⬀.)</li>
        <li>Go to <strong>Window → Show View → XPath/XQuery Builder</strong>. Set the dropdown in the upper left to XPath 3.1. Enter some XPath expressions (may span multiple lines; Enter for a new line). To run, hit Ctrl+Enter (Windows) or Cmd+Enter (MacOS), or click the red right-pointed triangle.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>The assignment</h2>
      <p>Respond to the XPath
         questions below in a text or markdown file, and <a href="https://canvas.psu.edu">upload to Canvas</a>
         for this assignment when you’re finished. (Please upload a file! If you paste your
         answers into the text box, Canvas may munch the code formatting.) I like using a separate text editor for this kind of exercise, or using the Tile Editors Vertically option in &lt;oXygen/&gt; (Window → Tile Editors Vertically). Some of these tasks are
         thought-provoking, and even difficult. If you get stuck, do the best you can, and if you
         can’t get a working answer, give the answers you tried and explain where they failed to get
         the results you wanted. Sometimes doing that will help you figure out what’s wrong, and
         even when it doesn’t, it will help us identify the difficult moments.  Consult our
         introductory guide <cite class="sub"><a href="explainXPath.html">Follow the
            XPath!</a></cite> for help with constructing your expressions.</p>
      
      <p>With the <i>Hamlet</i> play and th XPath browser window in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, construct XPath expressions that will do the following. <strong>Be sure to give the
         XPath expression you used in your answer, and don’t just report your results.</strong>
         This way, if the answer is incorrect, we can help explain what went wrong. </p>
      
     <ol>
        <li>Hamlet, like a typical Shakespearean tragedy, contains five acts, each of which contains scenes. Both acts and scenes are encoded as division (<code>&lt;div&gt;</code>) elements.
           <ol><li>How can XPath tell apart the acts and the scenes?</li>
              <li>What XPath would find just the acts?</li>
              <li>What XPath would find just the scenes?</li>
              <li>What Xpath would find just the scenes inside Act III?</li>
           </ol>
           </li>
        <li>Stage directions (<code>&lt;stage&gt;</code> occur in a variety of places in this XML file.
            <ol>
               <li>What XPath would find all of the stage directions that are inside a metrical line (<code>&lt;l&gt;</code>), that is, between the starting <code>&lt;l&gt;</code> and the ending <code>&lt;/&gt;></code>. How many stage directions are inside lines?</li>
               <li>What XPath would find all of the stage directions that are directly inside a speech (<code>&lt;sp&gt;</code>), that is inside a speech but <em>not</em> inside a line within a speech?</li>
               <li>What XPath would find all of the stage directions that are not directly inside a speech or a line? How many are there?</li>
               <li>For the stage directions you identified in #2c, above, write an XPath expression that will return not the <code>&lt;stage&gt;</code> elements themselves, but their parent elements, whatever they might be. What are those parent elements? (You haven't yet learned the XPath to return just the names of the parent elements [rather than the elements themselves], but you can locate them, click on each one in the list &lt;oXygen/&gt; returns, and look at it directly.)</li>
            </ol>
