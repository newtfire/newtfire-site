        <h3>The input collection on our textEncoding-Hub</h3> 	
        <p>For this assignment and the next, you will be working with a digitized XML collection of the Behrend family's travel letters from Europe made in Fall 2021. You will need to access this collection from our <strong>textEncoding-Hub</strong>, and one of our goals is for you to write XSLT to process <strong>a local directory of files</strong> rather than just one at a time as we have been doing up to this point. Here is how to access the directory:</p> 
        <ul><li>Access the directory by updating your local clone of the <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub">textEncoding-Hub</a>.</li>
            <li>Open the textEncoding-Hub locally on your computer, and find it by looking in <strong>Class-Examples</strong> and <strong>XSLT</strong>. Inside it is a directory named <strong><code>behrendTravel2021/</code></strong>. Inside this is a directory called <code>xml-letters/</code> that contains a few XML files that we are working with as a collection, a starter XSLT file to help you begin this assignment, and a <code>web-out/</code> with some sample output and CSS to style it.</li> 
            <li><strong>Copy the whole <code>behrendTravel2021/</code> directory to some other location on your computer</strong> outside of the textEncoding-Hub. (We do not want you to push your homework to the whole class over our textEncoding-Hub, so we just need you to make your own private copy of this directory to work with in the same folder in which you do your homework for this assignment and the next.</li>
            <li><em>Do not rename the file folder or the files inside</em>, because we need to refer to them as a coherent collection.</li></ul> 
        <p>Please be careful to <strong>copy</strong> rather the move the directory out of GitHub! If you move it out of the directory, the next time you sync our textEncoding-Hub, GitHub will prompt you to commit the change and push it, which will effectively eliminate the behrendTravel2021 folder. I can easily put it back if that happens, but please alert me ASAP if something goes awry!</p>
        <h3>Working with a Collection of Files in XSLT</h3>
        <p>We can process a whole directory of files using the <code>collection()</code> function in XSLT, so we can represent content from a whole collection of XML files in one or more output HTML files. One useful application for working with a collection is to process several short XML files and unify them on a single HTML page designed to merge their content. For this assignment, we will transform the small collection of XML files <!--and their associated images -->so that they output on one HTML page, which we will produce with a <dfn>table of contents</dfn>, followed by the full representations of each letter in the collection.</p>
        <p>Since these documents are all encoded with the same structural elements, we use the <code>collection()</code> function to reach into them as a group, and output their content one by one based on their XML hierarchy. We are actually treating the collection itself as part of the hierarchy as we write our XSLT, so we move from the directory down into the document node of each file to do our XSLT processing.</p>
        <h3>Using Modal XSLT</h3>
        <p>Besides working with a collection of files, the other interesting new application in this assignment is <strong>modal XSLT</strong>, which lets you <dfn>process the same nodes in your document in two different ways</dfn>. How can you output the same element contents to sit in a table of contents at the top of an HTML page, <em>and also</em> in another section of your document, below the table of contents? Wouldn’t it be handy to be able to have two completely different template rules that match exactly the same elements: one rule to output an element node selectively to preview in a table of contents, and the other to output the same node more fully in <code>section</code> or <code>div</code> elements? You can write two template rules that will match the same nodes (have the same value for their <code>@match</code> attribute), but how do you make sure that the correct template rule is handling the data in the correct place?</p>
        <p>To permit us to write multiple template rules that process the same input nodes in different ways for different purposes, we write <strong>modal XSLT</strong>, and that is what you will be learning to write with this assignment. Modal XSLT allows you to output the same parts of the input XML document in multiple locations and treat them differently each time. That is, it lets you have two different template rules for processing the same elements or other nodes in different ways, and you use the <code>@mode</code> attribute to control how the elements are processed <em>at a particular place</em> in the transformation. Please read the explanation and view the examples in <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/modal-xslt.html">Obdurodon’s tutorial on Modal XSLT</a> before proceeding with the assignment, so you can see where and how to set the <code>@mode</code> attribute and how it works to control processing.</p>
        <h3>Overview of the assignment</h3>
        <p>For this assignment you want to produce in one HTML page our collection of letters and documents, and that page needs to have a table of contents at the top. The table of contents should have one entry for each document, which
            produces the information we have encoded in <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element that is a descendant of the <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> element in our XML source code, together with the first line. Below the full table of contents you should output a new section that renders the complete text as encoded of all the documents. In the full text, you should wrap <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements around any markup of interest (including tagging of unclear passages, as well as persons, places, etc. Preserve some info from your source XML by outputting markup information in the HTML <code>@class</code> attribute.
            To generate the attribute value on @class, we used an Attribute Value Template, which you should review <a href="http://dh.obdurodon.org/avt.xhtml">here</a>.</p>
        <p>Here is a view of  
            <a href="behrendTravel2021/web-out/lettersOut.html">our output HTML</a>, but yours does not need to look exactly like ours. For this assignment, just concentrate on outputting the full text and the table of contents at the top. </p>
        <h3>Housekeeping with the stylesheet template and output line: From XML to XHTML</h3>
        <p>To ensure that the output would be in the XHTML namespace, we
            add a default namespace declaration (in <span style="color: purple;">purple</span>
            below). To output the required DOCTYPE declaration, we also created
            <code>&lt;xsl:output&gt;</code> element as the first child of our root
            <code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</code> element (in <span style="color:#006400;"
                >green</span> below), and we needed to include an attribute there to omit the default XML declaration because if we output it that XML line in our XHTML output, it will not produce valid HTML with the w3C and might produce quirky problems with rendering in various web browsers. So, our modified stylesheet template and xsl:output line is this, and you should locate this in the starter XSLT we provided (or otherwise copy it into a new XSLT file for working with a collection): </p>
        
        <pre>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
         &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform" version="3.0"
    <span style="color:purple;">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span>&gt;
    
   <span style="color:#800000;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" html-version="5" omit-xml-declaration="yes" 
              include-content-type="no" indent="yes"/&gt;</span>
    
    &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre>
        
        <h3>How to begin</h3>
        <p>First of all, file locations will be important in this assignment. Save your XSLT file just inside the behrendTravel2021/ directory that you copied to your local homework file space. The XSLT file should be sitting <dfn>outside</dfn> the <code>xml-letters/</code> directories.</p>
        <p>Forget about the table of contents for the moment and concentrate now on just outputting the
            full text of the documents. Except for having to pull the contents from a collection of files, this is just like the XML-to-HTML transformations you have
            already written, and you’ll use regular template rules (without a <code>@mode</code>
            attribute) to perform the transformation.</p>
        <p><strong>The collection() function:</strong> Here is how we write and run XSLT to process a collection of files. Just ahead of the first template match, after the <code>&lt;xsl:output method&gt;</code> statement, we define a <strong>variable</strong> in XSLT, which simply sets up a convenient shorthand for something complicated that we need to use more than once, so we don’t have to keep retyping it.</p>
        <div class="code">
            <span style="color:#800000;">&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" html-version="5" omit-xml-declaration="yes" 
                include-content-type="no" indent="yes"/&gt;</span><br/>
            <code>&lt;xsl:variable name="travelColl" as="document-node()+"
                select="collection('xml-letters/?select=*.xml')"/&gt;</code>
        </div>
        <p>An <code>xsl:variable</code> works by designating an <code>@name</code> which holds any name you like to refer to it later (we have used "travelColl" here to refer to the 2021 Behrend Travel Letters' collection of files), and with <code>@select</code> it holds anything you wish: a complicated XPath expression or a function, or whatever it is that is easier to store or process in a variable rather than typing it out multiple times. We use variables to help keep our code easy to read! In this case, we are using a variable to define our collection, using the <code>collection()</code> function in the <code>@select</code> attribute. The <code>collection()</code> function is set to <em>designate the directory location of the collection of letters in relation to the stylesheet I am currently writing</em>. My XSLT is saved in the directory immediately above the <code>xml-letters/</code> directory, so I am simply instructing the XSLT parser to take a directory-path step down to that directory. Definitely keep the the <code>?select=*.xml</code> because it helps make sure that only XML files are included in the collection, screening out the Relax NG file and hidden files that Mac or Windows operating systems sometimes add to file directories.</p>
        <p>We will call this variable later in the XSLT file whenever we need it, to show how we are stepping into our collection of documents. That will happen in the first template rule that matches on the root element. Open any one of the input XML files in the XML collection in &lt;oXygen/&gt; and you will see that the transcription contents are all coded within the <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code> element, so we can write this stylesheet to look through the whole collection of files and process only the elements below <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code>. You call or invoke the variable name for the collection by signalling it first with a dollar sign <code>$</code>, giving the variable name, and then simply step down the descendant axis straight to the <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code> element in each file. Here is how the code looks to call or invoke the variable in our first template match:</p>
        <div class="code"> 
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$travelColl//letter"/&gt;</code>
            
        </div>
        <p><strong>Note on running the transformation:</strong> Unlike other transformations we do on single XML files, when we run <em>this</em> XSLT in &lt;oXygen/&gt; it actually doesn’t matter what file we have selected in the XML input, because we have indicated in the stylesheet itself what we are processing, with the <code>collection()</code> function. We can even set a file that is outside of our collection as the input XML file (and we actually ran it successfully with the HTML file of the previous exercise selected). You do need to enter something in the input window, but when you work with the <code>collection()</code> function, your input file is just a dummy or placeholder that &lt;oXygen/&gt; needs to have entered so it can run your XSLT transformation.</p>
        
        <p>In <a href="behrendTravel2021/web-out/lettersOut.html">our HTML
                output</a> (scroll down past the table of contents, to where the full text of the
            letters is rendered), the parts of each letter are held and spaced apart using HTML
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. Here’s a sample of HTML output for
            one of our letter documents:</p>
        <pre>
        
          &lt;!-- I output the xml:id from the letter element as an id on an HTML div element to organize my letters on the page and prepare them for linking. --&gt;
           &lt;div class="letter" id="Greenwich-1955-07-18"&gt;
            
            
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="placeName"&gt;Departure. On Queen Elizabeth.&lt;/span&gt; At Noon, &lt;span class="date"&gt;July 18, 1955.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            
            &lt;p&gt;   We got on board about 10
               &lt;span class="persName"&gt;Harriet&lt;/span&gt; had stayed in &lt;span class="placeName"&gt;Greenwich&lt;/span&gt; over night so went in town with us. . . 
            &lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;/div&gt;
      
        </pre>
        <p style="font-size: smaller;"><strong>The fine print:</strong> Don’t worry if your HTML
            output isn’t structured exactly the same way ours is. But you should open your HTML output in &lt;oXygen/&gt; and simply check to make sure that what you’re producing is
            valid HTML and renders the text appropriately.</p> 
       
        <p>Remember to output span elements for interesting markup in the texts that you can style (later) with CSS.</p>
        <p>Once your documents are all being formatted correctly in HTML, you can add the
            functionality to create the table of contents at the top, using modal XSLT.</p>
        <h3 id="toc">Adding the table of contents</h3>
        <p>For this portion we are outputting an HTML table to show a little preview of information from each file in the collection. It may help to orient yourself to HTML table coding. HTML tables are organized in rows, using <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code> elements, which contain <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> elements (which means <q>table data</q>). You control the columns in an HTML table by the setting the <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> cells in an ordered sequence. Inside a <code>&lt;tr&gt;</code>, the first <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> is set in column 1, the second <code>&lt;td&gt;</code> in column 2, the third in column 3, and so on. The top row conventionally contains headings in <code>&lt;th&gt;</code> cells, which HTML will emphasize by default. Here is a simple HTML table (styled following our newtfire CSS, in which I’ve outlined the borders and given a background color to the table heading cells). Next to it is a view of the HTML code that creates the table structure: </p>
        
        <div class="codeContainFlex">
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Heading 1</th>
                    <th>Heading 2</th>
                    <th>Heading 3</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Row 1, cell 1</td>
                    <td>Row 1, cell 2</td>
                    <td>Row 1, cell 3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Row 2, cell 1</td>
                    <td>Row 2, cell 2</td>
                    <td>Row 2, cell 3</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <pre>
         &lt;table&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
             &lt;th&gt;Heading 1&lt;/th&gt;
             &lt;th&gt;Heading 2&lt;/th&gt;
             &lt;th&gt;Heading 3&lt;/th&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 1, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 1, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 1, cell 3&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;tr&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 2, cell 1&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 2, cell 2&lt;/td&gt;
             &lt;td&gt;Row 2, cell 3&lt;/td&gt;
          &lt;/tr&gt;
       &lt;/table&gt;</pre>
        </div>
        
        <p>The template rule for the document node in our solution, revised to output a table of
            contents with all the information we wish to show before the text of the letters, looks like the following:</p>
        
        <pre>
              &lt;xsl:variable name="travelColl" as="document-node()+"
        select="collection('xml-letters/?select=*.xml')"/&gt;

    &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
            &lt;head&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Behrend Travel Letters&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;

                &lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="webstyle.css"/&gt;
                
            &lt;/head&gt;
            &lt;body&gt;
                &lt;h1&gt;The Behrends' Travel Adventures in Europe&lt;/h1&gt;
                &lt;section id="toc"&gt;
                    &lt;h2&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt;
      
                <span class="code">&lt;!-- ebb: Let's set up the HTML table here. --&gt;

                            &lt;th&gt;Letter Date and opening&lt;/th&gt;&lt;!--first column table heading--&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;Places Mentioned&lt;/th&gt;&lt;!--third column table heading--&gt;
                            &lt;th&gt;People Mentioned&lt;/th&gt;&lt;!--second column table heading--&gt;
                            
                        &lt;/tr&gt;
                        
                        &lt;!--ebb: Here we use our $travelColl variable pointing into the collection and use modal XSLT: --&gt;
                      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$travelColl//letter" mode="toc"/&gt;</span>
                       
                        
                    &lt;/table&gt;
                &lt;/section&gt;

                &lt;section id="fulltext"&gt;
                    &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$travelColl//letter"/&gt;
      
                &lt;/section&gt;
            &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;  
        </pre>
        
        

        <p>The highlighted code is what we added to include a table of contents, and the important
            line is <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="$travelColl//letter" mode="toc"/&gt;</code>. This is
            going to apply templates to each document <em>with the <code>@mode</code> attribute value
                set to <q>toc</q>.</em> The value of the <code>@mode</code> attribute is up to you
            (we used <q>toc</q> for <q>table of contents</q>), but whatever you call it, setting the
            <code>@mode</code> to any value means that only template rules that also specify a
            <code>@mode</code> with that same value will fire in response to this
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> element. Now we have to go write those
            template rules!</p>
        <p>What this means is that if you write ew template rules to process the <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;letters&gt;</code> elements to
            output the titles with the full text of the documents, you use <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> and
            <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> elements without any <code>@mode</code> attribute.
            To create the table of contents, though, you can have
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code>
            elements that select or match the same elements, but <strong>that specify a mode and apply
            completely different rules</strong>. A template rule for <code>&lt;letter&gt;</code> elements in
            table-of-contents mode will start with <code>&lt;xsl:template match="letter"
                mode="toc"&gt;</code>, and you need to tell it to create an <code>&lt;td&gt;</code>
            element that contains the text of the <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> element. You can then apply-templates with <code>mode="toc"</code>. The rule for those same elements not in any mode will start with
            <code>&lt;xsl:template match="letter"&gt;</code> (without the <code>@mode</code>
            attribute). That rule can create a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element for each letter, and then output the full text of the document using <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements. In this way, you can have two
            sets of rules for the letters, one for the table of contents and one to output the full text, and we use
            modes to ensure that each is used only in the correct place.</p>
        <p><em>Remember: both the <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code>, which tells the system
            to process certain nodes, and the <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code> that responds to
            that call and does the processing must agree on their mode values.</em> For the main
            output of the full text of every letter, neither the
            <code>&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</code> nor the <code>&lt;xsl:template&gt;</code>
            elements specifies a mode. To output the table of contents, both specify the same
            mode.</p>

                XSLT transformations inside &lt;oXygen/&gt; in our <a href="explainXSLT.html">Intro to XSLT tutorial</a>.) If you don’t get
                the results you expect and can’t figure out what you’re doing wrong, remember that you can post a query to our DIGIT-Coders Slack or the <a href="https://github.com/newtfire/textEncoding-Hub/issues">textEncoding-Hub Issues board</a>. You can’t just ask for the answer,
                though; you need to describe what you tried, what you expected, what you got, and
                what you think the problem is. We often find, just as we’re preparing to post our
                own queries to coding discussion boards, that having to write up a description
                of the problem helps us think it through and solve it ourselves. We’re also
                encouraging you to discuss the homework on the discussion boards because that’s also
                helpful for the person who responds. Answering someone else’s
                inquiry and troubleshooting someone else’s problem often helps us clarify matters for
                ourselves!</li>
            
            <li>When you complete this assignment, submit your XSLT file and your output HTML file to Canvas, following our usual homework file-naming conventions. You need not generate CSS for this, because we will ask you to create one for a modified version of this output in <a href="XSLTExercise-5BTrav.html">the next assignment</a>.</li>
