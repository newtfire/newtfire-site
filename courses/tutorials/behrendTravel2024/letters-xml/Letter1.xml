<!--JJB: Here are some notes as to my initial markup in regards to elements and attributes.
- HeadLine contains all the psuedo meta data about where they are and when they are there at the top of each letter.
- location is just any locaion
    - category is meant to be the type of location so for example the first instance is "ship" because they are on the Queen Elizabeth
    - spec is short for specific which is to give more specific context so for the first instance it is "Atlantic" because they are in the atlantic ocean. If she wrote that they were still moored in New York for example then "Atlantic" would be "NewYork"
- imp is short for imperfection
    - type is the type of imperfection, seems like the most common wil by typos 
        - typo is fortypos
        - missing is for missing letters
        - stray is for stray characters
    - corr is short for correction, basically what the correct version of the marked word should be.-->
