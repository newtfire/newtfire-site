           <ln n="24"/> errected on the further side of the river connected with

            <ln n="6"/>fitted into an alcove.(such a steep narrow stairway
            <ln n="7"/>to get up to this room) Across the <imp type="crossout">l</imp> little hall was father
            <ln n="8"/>a spacious room which<imp type="writing">/</imp>contained a large collection of
            <ln n="9"/>Jo Davidson's work. Almost entirely busts of famous
            <ln n="10"/>people. A life size figure of Gertrude Stien. The busts
            <ln n="11"/>were all arranged on tall swuare pedestals of varying

            <ln n="19"/>Azay d'Rideau. A heavenly place surrounded by a moat
            <ln n="20"/>filled with water(as it should be!) It was then quite
            <ln n="21"/>dark. People sat about in the ground on rugs- some
            <ln n="22"/>walked about. Beautiful music and a story of a tragic

            <ln n="24"/>from the castly windows. The windows being lit as it
