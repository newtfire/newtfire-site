       <h2>Create Shell Aliases and System <q>Dot Files</q></h2>

      <p>In this assignment, you will learn to create aliases (or shortcut commands) for yourself, as well as create and modify 
        some system <q>dot files</q>:
            <strong>.bashrc or .bash_profile system files on Windows</strong>, or your<strong>
            .zshrc on Mac and Linux</strong>. <br />This is necessary for upcoming units in the
         course that require configuring software that runs from your shell.</p>
      <p>For this assignment, follow <a class="inline_disabled"

            target="_blank" rel="noopener">this helpful tutorial</a> create an alias (or shortcut)
         for&nbsp; your GitHub folder (or wherever your store your GitHub repositories) on your
         computer so you can reach it with one easy word. You may also write aliases to be shortcuts
         for common shell commands.</p>

                        .zshrc (Mac) "system dot file" to hold keyboard shortcuts
                        ("aliases")</span><span class="external_link_icon" role="presentation"><span
                           class="screenreader-only">.</span></span></a>: A system "dot file" is
                  basically hidden and powerful (designed to be invisible so you do not accidentally
                  munge or delete it. These are called "dot files" because the filename actually
                  begins with a period or "dot" like this <code>.bashrc</code>. <ul>
                     <li>Inside your .bashrc or your .zshrc you can set an alias to open your shell,
                        type the word "github" as shorthand for<span>&nbsp;</span><code>cd
                           file/path/to/your/GitHubFolder</code>.&nbsp;</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>To do this so that your commands work, you need: <ul>
                     <li>to find where your .bashrc and .zshrc files are stored on your computer.
                        Usually this is in the "home" location, which you can find with the command
                           <code>cd </code> (or cd + the space-bar)</li>
                     <li>to know the filepath to the location of the directory that you want to
                        access with the alias.</li>
                     <li>to clearly understand how to write filepaths from one location to another
                        on your computer.</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
