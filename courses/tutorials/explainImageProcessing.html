      <h3>Imaging archival documents</h3>
      <p>We take photos using a phone or a hand-held camera. Why not a flatbed scanner? Because in the archives a phone (or a hand-held camera) is less invasive or potentially damaging to the archival material. In the archives we need to minimize the amount of physical manipulation of documents in order to protect them.</p>
         
         <p>These notes are based on recent experience (2018 and later) with photographing hundreds of handwritten nineteenth-century documents in various library archives. In our experience, a smart phone camera set to focus on the text written on a manuscript had the effect of enhancing the clarity and sharpness of the text by effectively <q>flattening</q> the surface. When we worked with a hand-held camera, the precision of the imaging would sometimes result in blurred areas from shadows on the surface that we did not see when photographing with a smart phone. We are now, as a result, relying on smart phones in the library archives.

<h3>Image File Formats</h3>
      
      <p>For building a digital archive published in HTML on the web, we need interchangeable image file formats. Acceptable image formats for reliably sharing over the web are jpeg, png, and gif, about which [read more here](https://www.unleadedsoftware.com/news/jpg-png-or-gif-which-one-should-you-use-and-when). Of these, the one produced by cameras is typically the jpg. </p>
      
      <h4>File extensions:</h4>
      
      <ul>
         <li>.jpg (or .jpeg)</li>
         <li>.png </li>
         <li>.gif</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>When taking pictures with your camera, you will need to upload them to a computer and organize them according to a good system for your project. You will not need for your images to be so large when distributing over the web, because web browsers tend to magnify the images, and because large file sizes will slow peopleâ€™s interaction with the website you are building. **GitHub has a strict limit preventing commits and pushes of files at or above 100MB.** Most individual photos taken with a
