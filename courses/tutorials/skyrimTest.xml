        This is yet another Skyrim book. I like them. I picked this book because, as a player, 
        I really truly enjoyed it. Most players of Oblivion (Skyrim's predecessor, which occurred 
        in the same world, but 200 years earlier) would; it actually recaps the main quest of the 
        previous game, from the perspective of a historian. The nature of Bethesda games allows 
        for a great amount of player freedom, and so some details of this book could be correct 
        for how one player experienced it, but completely inaccurate when describing another 
        player's game. This is why the hero's alignment and loyalty is left neutral; many players 
        choose to be evil, and may have ignored the main quest entirely. For this markup, I chose 
        to highlight all the events in the main quest which would stick out to an Oblivion player 
        interested to see how his hero's saga has been told. -->

        <subtitle>A summary of the events stemming from <event>the assassination of <char
                    ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</char></event></subtitle>
    </source>
    <body>
        <para>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <event>the <char
                    ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor Uriel Septim VII</char> was
                assassinated</event> and <event>the <item>Amulet of Kings</item>
                was destroyed</event>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
            down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.</para>

        <para><event>The <faction ref="MythicDawn">assassins</faction> first attacked the
                    <char ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</char></event> in the
                <place>White Gold Tower</place>. While the <faction ref="blades"
                >Blades</faction> held <faction ref="MythicDawn">them</faction> back,
                <event>the <char ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</char> made <char
                    ref="UrielSeptim">his</char> way down to the
                <place>dungeons</place></event>, to a <place>secret escape
                route</place> built into <place>one of the prison cells</place>. For
            reasons known only to <char ref="UrielSeptim">himself</char>, the <char
                ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</char>
            <event>pardoned the fortunate <char ref="hero"
                >prisoner</char></event> in that <place>cell</place>. Some say the
                <char ref="hero">prisoner</char> reminded <char ref="UrielSeptim"
                >him</char> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <event>moment of
                prophecy</event>. Whatever the case, the <char ref="hero"
                >prisoner</char> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
                <place>Empire</place> and <place>Tamriel</place> - surely a sign that
            the gods themselves were at work.</para>

        <para>The pursuing <event><faction ref="MythicDawn">assassins</faction> killed the
                    <faction ref="blades">Blades</faction> bodyguards</event> in a relentless
            series of sneak attacks. Eventually <event><faction ref="MythicDawn">they</faction>
                struck down the <char ref="UrielSeptim">Emperor</char>
                <char ref="UrielSeptim">himself</char></event>. Before <char
                ref="UrielSeptim">he</char> fell, <event><char ref="UrielSeptim"
                    >Uriel Septim VII</char> gave the <item>Amulet of Kings</item> to
                the <char ref="hero">prisoner</char></event>, who somehow
                <event>made it out of the <place>Imperial sewers</place></event> and
            into the light of day.</para>

        <para>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <faction
                ref="MythicDawn">daedric cultists</faction> known as the <faction ref="MythicDawn"
                >Mythic Dawn</faction>. (Those who still suspect the <faction ref="DarkBrotherhood"
                >Dark Brotherhood</faction> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
            needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <faction
                ref="DarkBrotherhood">Dark Brotherhood</faction> would never be so foolish as to
                <event>effectively declare war on the Empire</event> and thus ensure their
            complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic
                Dawn</faction>.)</para>

        <!---A small note about the inclusion of an effective declaration of war on the Empire as a quest event: in Skyrim, the main quest for the Dark Brotherhood is to assassinate the Emperor of Tamriel. This amused me, so I included it.-->

        <para>The <item>Amulet of Kings</item> next surfaced at <place>Weynon
                Priory</place> near <place type="city">Chorrol</place>. <char

            Unbeknownst even to <char ref="MartinSeptim">himself</char>, <char

            Throne. <char ref="MartinSeptim">He</char> alone could use the

            barrier between <place>Tamriel</place> and <place>Oblivion</place>, and save
            the world from the <faction ref="MythicDawn">Mythic Dawn</faction> plot.</para>

        <para><event>The <char ref="hero">prisoner</char> arrived at <place

                <char ref="Jauffre">Jauffre</char> survived the attack, however, and

                made their way to <place>Cloud Ruler Temple</place></event>, bastion of

            that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <char
