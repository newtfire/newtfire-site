 What did you put on me? 
 A Stinging Jinx. 
 How long will it last? 
 Not long. 
 Show me. 
 Get Draco. 
 Why Draco? 
 Just sit back and watch, Lucius. Hm? Pour yourself another glass
                of wine. 
 Where’d you find them? 
 In the North Forest. 
 Lovely scarf, Scabior. Though I’m not sure it’s your color. 
 It’s not mine. 
 You don’t say. 
 Fancy her, do you, Scabior? Can’t say I blame you. Maybe we’ll
                workout a little reward for you, hm? That is, assuming all is as it appears. Ah,
                Draco. Come here, darling. 
 My friends here say they’ve got Harry Potter. Seeing as he’s an
                old school chum of yours, I thought you could confirm the fact for us. 
 Well...? 
 I can’t... I can’t be sure. 
 Look close, Draco. If we’re the ones who hand Potter over to the Dark
                Lord, everything will be forgiven. Do you understand -
 Now, we won’t be forgetting who
                actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy? 
 Of course not. 
 Narcissa. Tend to
                your husband. Lucius staggers back nervously next to his wife. 

                
 Don’t be shy, sweetheart. Get up nice and close.
 What’s wrong with his face? 
 What is wrong with his face, Scabior? 
 He came to us that way. I reckon he picked it up in the forest. 
 Or ran into a Stinging Jinx. 
 Was it you, dearie? Give me her wand. We’ll see what the last
                spell was. 
 What is that? 
 Where did you get that! 
 It was in her bag when we searched her. Reckon it’s mine now. 
 Are you mad! 
 How dare you! Release me, woman! 
 Go. GO! 
 Wormtail. Put these two in the cellar. I want to have a little
                conversation with this one. Girl to girl. 
 Harry! What’re we going to do? We can’t just leave Hermione alone with
                her! 
 Ron? Harry...? 
 Luna...? 
 This sword is meant to be in my vault at Gringotts. How did you
                get it? 
 I don’t know what you’re talking about.
 Liar. What else did you take? 
 You look strange, Harry. Mr. Ollivander, look who’s here. It’s Harry
                Potter.
 Hello, sir. 
 I’m going to ask you once again: what else did
                you and your friends take from my vault! 
 I told you. I don’t know what you’re talking
                -Hermione SCREAMS in pain. wall, turns. Ron slams his fist against the 
 We have to do something, Harry! 
 There’s no way out. We’ve tried everything. 
 You’re bleeding, Harry. 
 That’s a curious thing to hide in your sock. 
 You were hiding it, weren’t you? 
 Help us. 
 Let her go! Let her go! 
 Shut it! You. Goblin. Come with me. 
 Dobby. What’re you doing here? 
 Dobby has come to rescue HarryPotter, of course. 
 Do you mean to say you can Apparate in and out of here? And take us
                with you? 
 Of course. I’m an elf. 
 Works for me. 
 Right. Dobby, I want you to takeLuna and Mr. Ollivander to -
 Shell Cottage on the outskirts of Tinworth. 
 Trust me. 
 You’ll see to Mr. Ollivander? 
 Of course. 
 Whenever you’re ready, sir.
 Like her very much. 
 Meet me at the top
                of the stairs in ten seconds.
 Who gets his wand? 
 Sss.
 Well? 
 I left Gringotts employ many weeks ago, but when I was last in your
                vault, the sword was there. 
 Perhaps it just walked out on its own then. 
 There is no place safer than Gringotts, Madam LeStrange. 
 Liar! You can’t deceive me! 
 Consider yourself lucky, Goblin. The same won’t be said for this
                one. 
 Like hell! 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Stupefy! 
 Stop or she dies! 
 Drop your wands. Ron stands rigidly, staring balefully at
                Bellatrix. 
 I said drop them! 

                
 All right!
 Pick them up, Draco. Now! Well, well, look what we have here.
                Harry Potter. All bright, shiny and new again. Just in time for the Dark Lord. 
 Call him, Draco.
 Stupefy! 
 You dirty little monkey! You could have killed me! 
 Dobby meant only to maim or seriously injure, not kill. 
 For God’s sake, Cissy, you’ve got a wand! Use it! 
 How dare you take a witch’s wand. How dare you defy your masters. 
 Dobby has no master! Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save
                Harry Potter and his friends! 
 Give the Dark Lord our regards.
 It’s all right, Hermione. You’re safe. We’re all safe. 
 Dobby... no... 
 It’s okay... Here... Just hold on, Dobby... I’ll fix you -- Hermione--
                your bag --you must have something -- Essence of Dittany -- something... Hermione!
                Help me! 
 Such a beautiful night... to be with friends. Dobby is happy... to be
                with his friend... Harry Potter...
 Fleur’s seeing to Ollivander. Anyone else need tending -
 We should close his eyes. Don’t you think? 
 There. Now he could be sleeping. 
 Harry. It’s all right. That it hurts. That’s what reminds us how lucky
                we are to be alive. 
 I want to bury him properly. Without magic. 
 It’s beautiful here. 
 It was our Aunt’s. We used to come here as kids. The Order uses it now
                as a safe house -- what’s left of us, at least. 
 Muggles think these keep evil away. But they’re wrong... 
 I need to talk to the goblin.
 How are you? 
 Alive. 
 You probably don’t remember -
 -- that I showed you to your vault the first time you visited
                Gringotts? Even amongst goblins, you are famous, Harry Potter. 
 You buried the elf. I saw you. 
 Yes. 
 And brought me here. 
 You are a very unusual wizard. 
 Why did you leave Gringotts? 
 Soon the Death Eaters will control it. That was unacceptable to me. 
 Then you’re on our side. 
 This is a wizard’s war. I take no side. 
 I need to get inside Gringotts, into one of the vaults. 
 It is impossible. 
 Alone, yes. With you, no. 
 How did you come by this sword? 
 It’s complicated. Why did Bellatrix Lestrange think it should be in
                her vault at Gringotts? 
 It’s complicated. 
 The sword presented itself to us in a moment of need. We didn’t steal
                it. 
 There is a sword in Madam Lestrange’s vault identical to this one,
                but it is a fake. It was placed there this past summer. 
 And she never suspected? 
 The replica is very convincing. Only a goblin would recognize that
                this is the true Sword of Gryffindor. 
 Who put it there? The fake. 
 It was not my place to ask, nor did I desire to. There are more
                than a few curious things in the vaults at Gringotts. 
 And in Madam Lestrange’s vault as well? 
 Perhaps. 
 I have gold. Lots of it. 
 I have no interest in gold. Then what?
 The goblin twists the curl at his chin... then his eyes drift once
                again to the sword. Harry starts to respond, but the goblin cuts him off with
                finality. 
 That is my price. 
 All right.
 I have your word, Harry Potter, that you will give me the Sword of
                Gryffindor if I help you? Griphook extends his hand. Harry reaches out, takes it.
            
 Harry, are you thinking there’s a Horcrux in Bellatrix’s vault? 
 She was terrified when she thought we’d been in there. She kept asking
                you what else we’d taken. I’d bet anything there’s a Horcrux there. If we find it,
                we can kill it. And if we kill it, we’re one step closer to killing him. 
 And if we find one? How’re we supposed to destroy it if we’ve given
                Griphook the sword? 
 I’m still working on that part. FLEUR exits the room ahead, a
                half-empty bowl in hand. Seeing Harry, she stops, effectively barring the door. 
 He’s too weak. 
 Forgive me if I don’t get up. 
 Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions. 
 Anything, m’boy, anything. 
 Can you identify these, sir? 
 Walnut and dragon heartstring. Twelve and three quarter inches.
                Unyielding. This belongs to Bellatrix Lestrange. 
 And this? 
 Hawthorn. Unicorn hair. Ten inches. Reasonably pliant. This was
                the wand of Draco Malfoy. 
 Was? Isn’t it still? 
 Perhaps not -- if you won it from him. I sense its allegiance has
                changed. 
 You talk about wands like they’ve got feelings. Can think. 
 The wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. That much has always
                been clear to those of us who have studied wandlore. 
 What do you know about the Deathly Hallows, sir? 
 There are rumored to be three: The Elder Wand, the Resurrection
                Stone and the Invisibility Cloak. It is said that to possess the mall is to make
                oneself the Master of Death. But few truly believe such objects exist -
 But you, sir? Do you believe they exist? 
 I see no reason to put stock in an old wives tale -
 You’re lying. You know one exists and you told him about it. You told
                him about the Elder Wand and where to go looking for it. 
 He tortured me! Besides, I conveyed only rumors. There’s no
                guarantee he will find it -
 He has found it, sir. 
 That’s all, sir. We’ll leave you to get some rest now. 
 He’s after you, Mr. Potter. If it’s true, what you say, that he
                has the Elder Wand, I’m afraid you really don’t stand a chance. 
 Then I guess I’ll just have to kill him before he finds me, sir. 
 You’re sure it’s hers? 
 Positive. 
 I reckon you should take this then. 
 Can’t I use the other? 
 You heard Ollivander. It’s Harry’s now. 
 But I hate that thing -- that’s the wand that killed Sirius! How
                can I hold it and not feel... 
 If I can hold it, you can. 
 How will we know what it is when we get in there? After all, a Horcrux
                can be anything. 
 I’ll know. I can’t explain. It’s like... 
 ... they sing to me.
 That’s a bit scary. 
 It is, Harry. Did Dumbledore ever say anything to you, something
                that might explain why -
 No. I just know. When one’s near. 
 This is the closest I could find to what you described, Hermione. 
 It’s perfect. Thank you, Fleur. 
 You’re leaving, aren’t you. 
 In the morning. 
 And Griphook? 
 He’ll be leaving too. 
 Listen, I don’t know what you’re up to, but I know goblins. If you’ve
                struck any kind of bargain with Griphook, you must be exceptionally careful to live
                up to it. If you don’t... he won’t be forgiving. 
 The sky has lost a star. Luna’s image skitters
                across the mirror’s surface and Harry looks up, finds her standing there clutching
                as mall TRAVELING BAG, staring at Dobby’s stone. 
 My father used to say that when a child died. 
 Funny how Mr. Dobby knew exactly where to find us. 
 Yeah. Funny. Listen, Luna, about your father, I don’t want you to
                think I -
 I know you understand why my father did what he did, Harry. That’s why
                we don’t need to talk about it. 
 Hogwarts? 
 It’s not the place you left, you know. It’s not the same. 
 Neither am I. 
 Always good value. I’ll miss her.
 What d’you think? 
 Wouldn’t know you if I didn’t know you. 
 You want to tell me what that is? 
 Sirius gave it to me. He had a matching piece. He said if I ever
                needed him, all I had to do was look into it. 
 You mean he could see you? 
 Something like that. I don’t know. He died before I ever got to use
                it. The thing is... 
 Go on. 
 You’ll think I’m mental, but more than once, when I’ve looked into it
                -- I think I’ve seen Dumbledore. 
 Bloody hell... that’s a sight. 
 Well, how do I look? 
 Hideous. 
 Oh dear, I missed a spot, didn’tI? Hold still... 
 Couldn’t do anything about that bit in the back that’s always flipping
                up, could you? Dead annoying -
 Never mind. I’m good. (peering warily at her) That is you in there,
                isn’t it? 
 You can give that to Hermione to 
 Madam Lestrange. 
 Good morning. The Warlock eyes her
                oddly, then continues on. As Hermione retreats back into the alley, Griphook emerges
                from the shadows, his voice harsh and mocking. 
 Good morning? Good morning? You’re Bellatrix Lestrange, not some
                dewy-eyed schoolgirl! 
 Hey. Easy. 
 She gives us away and we might as well use that sword to slit our
                own throats. Understand? 
 He’s right. I was being stupid. 
 C’mon. Let’s do it. 
 Identification. 
 I hardly think that will be 
 Madam Lestrange! Dear me! How may I help
                you today? 
 I wish to enter my vault. 
 I see. Very well. Excuse me, won’t you?
 I don’t like to be kept waiting.
 Next. 
 He’s with me. 
 As
                difficult as that may be to imagine.
 They know! Ron stiffens, turns slightly toward
                the empty spot to his left. WHISPERS: 
 What do you mean? 
 They know she’s an imposter! They’ve been
                warned! Ron looks back, watches the two goblins return to Hermione. 
 Madam Lestrange. Would you mind presenting your wand? 
 And why should I do that? 
 Harry, what do we do? Harry...?
 It’s the bank’s policy. I’m sure you understand, given the current
                climate --
 No, I most certainly do not understand --
 I’m afraid I must insist. 
 The door glides shut. The wind dies. Bogrod
                blinks. 
 Very well, Madam Lestrange. you will follow me. If 
 But... Bogrod, there have been special instructions regarding
                theLestrange vault. 
 I’m fully aware of that. I’m also aware the Lestranges are one of our
                oldest and most respected families. 
 Yes, sir, but our instructions are very specific -BOGROD Let me
                be specific with you, Ricbert. I’ve run this bank for forty-five years, long before
                anyone had even heard of a Death Eater. The day may come that they feel they can run
                this place better than me, but that day has not yet arrived. Am I understood! The
                Aged Goblin hesitates, then nods. Hermione. Bogrod turns to 
 Madam, if you will, I will escort you myself. 
 Teffington, see to that door, will you. The guard glances at Ron,
                then reluctantly heads for the entrance. Ron quickly falls in line behind Hermione
                as Bogrod leads them out of the Hall. 
 How long before they come after us? 
 Time will tell. 
 What’s that? Up ahead. 
 I should have known -
 What is that, Griphook? 
 Griphook! What is that! 
 Well done. Hey. 
 You look like... you.
                Hermione is soaking wet and looks like... Hermione. Ron looks like Ron. Griphook
                nods to the waterfall. 
 The Thief’s Downfall. Washes away all enchantments. Can be deadly. 
 You don’t say. (as the cart’s alarms 
 No. 
 What the devil are you all doing down here! 
 We need him! 
 Is this your doing, Griphook? You have no rights here anymore. When
                you gave up your keys, you -
 Imperio! 
 Well done. 
 No. It’s not possible... 
 Bloody hell. That’s a Welsh 
 It looks like it’s been down here forever.
 Go on. 
 It’s been trained to expect pain when it hears the noise.
 That’s barbaric. I...
 We’ll only have a few seconds. In other words... they’ll be no
                do-overs. Understood?
 Ready, Bogrod? 
 Hm? Oh. Yes. Of course.
 Blimey... 
 Look.
 No wonder Bellatrix thought it was real.
 Is it here, Harry? Can you feel anything?
 It’s hot!
 They’ve added Gemino and Flagrante Curses! Everything you touch
                will burn and multiply!
 Ron, your foot!
 We’ll be crushed! Hurry! 
 That’s it. Up there. 
 How’re we going to reach it? 
 Give me the sword! The real one.
 Keep going!
 Harry! Behind you!
 The cup!
 In here!
 We have a deal, Griphook.
 I said I’d get you in. I never said anything about getting you
                out.
 Griphook! Griphook! 
 Thieves! Help! Thieves! 
 Foul little git. Least we’ve got Bogrod. 
 That’s unfortunate. 
 We can’t just stand here! Who’s got an idea? 
 You’re asking us? You’re the brilliant one. 
 I’ve got something. But it’s mad. 
 Relashio! 
 That’s your idea? 
 Come on! 
 It doesn’t realize it’s free! (trying out spells) Leviosa! Aviates!
                Ex Cappa! 
 That was brilliant! BRILLIANT! 
 Bloody hell.
 We’re dropping! The dragon circles, lower and lower. A lake shimmers. 
 I say we jump! 
 When? 
 NOW! 
 The boy has discovered our secret, Nagini. We must find out just
                how much he knows. We must return to our hiding places and see if the others are
                safe.
 And you, my friend, must stay
                close...
 He knows. 
 You-Know-Who. He knows we broke into
                Gringotts. He knows what we took. He knows we’re hunting Horcruxes. 
 How is it you -
 I saw him. 
 You let him in! Harry, you can’t -
 I can’t always help it, Hermione! 
 Maybe I can.
                I don’t know. 
 He’s going to make sure the other 
 He’s angry. But he’s scared too. 
 What happens when he finds out four are gone? 
 I reckon he’ll do anything to stop us from finding the rest. There’s
                more: one of them’s at Hogwarts.
What? 
 You saw it? 
 I saw the castle. And Rowena Ravenclaw. I think it must have something
                to do with her. We have to go there, now. 
 Tonight? But we have to plan. We have to figure out what -
 Honestly, Hermione, when have any of our plans actually worked? We
                plan, we get there and all hell breaks loose. 
 ‘Fraid he’s right. One problem: Snape’s Headmaster now. We can’t just
                walk in the front door. 
 We’ll go to Hogsmeade. To Honeydukes. Take the secret passage in the
                cellar. 
 There’s something wrong with him. In the past, I could always follow
                his thoughts. Now everything feels disconnected. 
 Maybe it’s because of the Horcruxes. Maybe he’s growing weaker. Maybe
                he’s dying. 
 No. It’s more like he’s wounded. If anything, he feels more dangerous.
            
 They were ready for us.

                
 We know you’re here, Potter. There’s no getting away.

                
 Perhaps you need some convincing. 
 What’s he mean by that?
 No, you’ll give us away.
 Expecto Patronum! 

            
 It’s him! He’s down there!
 In here, Potter.
 Did you get a look at him! For a second I thought it was -
 I know. Hearing this, Harry
                slips the mirror from his pocket. FOOTSTEPS sound from below. 
 Harry! I can see you! In here! 
 You bloody fools! What were you thinking coming here? Do you have
                any idea how dangerous it is --
 You’re Aberforth. 
 Dumbledore’s brother. It’s you I’ve been seeing -- here. It’s you who
                sent Dobby. 
 Where’ve you left him? 
 He’s dead. 
 Sorry to hear it. I liked that elf. 
 How’d you come by it? 
 Mundungus Fletcher, ‘bout a year ago. 
 Dung had no right selling you that. It belonged to -ABERFORTH Sirius.
                Albus told me. He also told me that you’d likely be hacked off if you ever found out
                I had it. But ask yourself whereyou’d be if I didn’t. Harry doesn’t respond. 
 Right then. Reckon you’re hungry. Let’s get you fed, then think of
                the best way to get you out ofhere. 
 Do you hear much from the others? From the Order? 
 The Order is finished. You-KnowWho’s won. Anyone who says
                otherwise is kidding themselves. The trio exchange glances. HARRY doesn’t touch the
                food, just stares quietly at ABERFORTH. 
 We need to get into Hogwarts. Dumbledore gave us a job to do. Did he
                now? 
 Nice job? Easy? An awkward silence, the tension heavy. 
 We’ve been hunting Horcruxes. We think the last one’s in the school.
                But we’ll need your help getting in. 
 
 If we can find it and kill it, then we kill him,
                and then we can end this war once and for all. We need to get into Hogwarts tonight.
                Aberforth stares at him for a moment, until the silence grows. 
 It’s not a job my brother’s given you, it’s a suicide mission. Do
                yourself a favor boy. Go home. Live a little longer. 
 Dumbledore trusted me, to see this through. 
 What makes you think you can trust him! What makes you think you
                can believe anything my brother told you! In all the time you knew him, did he ever
                mention my name? Did he ever mention hers? 
 Why should he... 
 You tell me. 
 I only care about the Dumbledore I knew. I trusted him. 
 And why is that? 
 I had no reason not to - 
 That’s a boy’s answer. A boy who goes chasing Horcruxes on the
                word of a man who won’t even tell him where to start. You’re lying. Not just to me,
                which doesn’t matter, but to yourself as well. That’s what a fool does. You’re
                drunk. 
 
 You don’t strike me as a fool, Mr. Potter. So I’ll ask you again.
                There must be a reason. Why do you trust anything my brother ever said to you? Why? 
 Because I need to. Because if I don’t, I don’t know who I am anymore.
                I’ve lost too many people to lie down now. I’m not interested in what happened
                between you and your brother, I don’t even care that you’ve given up. I trust the
                man I knew. I’m going to see this through. 
 I need to get into
                the castle tonight. Silence. HERMIONE and RON exchange a glance. ABERFORTH regards
                HARRY darkly, but HARRY merely stands, waiting. After several seconds, Aberforth’s
                gaze shifts... to the painting. 
 You know what to do... 
 Where’ve you sent her? 
 You’ll see soon enough. 
 That’s Ariana, isn’t it? Your sister. She’s beautiful. 
 She’ll always be beautiful.
 * She died very young, didn’t she.
 My brother sacrificed many things, Mr. Potter, in his journey to
                find power, including her. She was devoted to him --he gave her everything, but
                time. 
 Mr. Dumbledore... thank you. 
 Did save our lives twice. Kept an eye on us in that mirror. That
                doesn’t seem like someone who’s given up, does it? 
 She’s coming back! And she’s got someone with her! 
 Who’s that with her? Bloody hell... 
 I knew you’d come! I told them all! Harry Potter would never abandon
                Hogwarts! 
 Neville... The GILDED FRAME SWINGS OPEN,
                revealing -- in actuality -- what the painting had replicated. Harry pelts
                forward... 
 Neville, you look... 
 Like hell? I reckon. This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see.
                Hermione! Ron!
 Hey, Ab. There might be a couple more people on the way.
 Well? Ready? 
 I don’t remember this being on the Marauder’s Map. 
 That’s because it never existed till now. The seven secret passages
                were sealed off before the start of the year. This is the only way in or out now.
                The grounds are crawling with Death Eaters and Dementors. 
 How bad is it, Neville? With Snape as Headmaster. 
 Hardly ever see him. It’s the Carrows you have to watch out for. 
 The Carrows? 
 Brother and sister. They’re in charge of discipline. Like
                punishment, the Carrows. 
 They did that to you? But why? 
 Today’s Dark Arts lesson had us practicing the Cruciatus Curse. On
                First Years. I refused. Hogwarts has changed. 
 Aw, c’mon. Don’t be grim. We’re all used to it by now. And the thing
                is, it helps when people stand up, gives everyone hope. I used to notice that when
                you did it, Harry. C’mon, we’re almost there. 
 Let’s have a bit of fun, shall we? 
 Hey! Listen up, you lot! I’ve brought you a surprise! 
 Not more of Aberforth’s cooking, I hope. Be a
                surprise if we could digest it.
 Blimey.
 Get the word out to Remus and the others that Harry’s back.
 River, DA calling. Do you read? We have a new weather report:
                Lightning has struck. I repeat, lightning has struck... 
 Okay, okay! Stand down! Let’s not kill them before You-Know-Who gets
                the chance! 
 Right then. What’s the plan, Harry? Harry
                gazes out over the expectant faces in the room, noting the hollow eyes and broken
                bodies and the desperate, almost palpable desire for hope. For a moment he seems
                lost, awed by the sacrifice his friends have made, much of it for him. Finally, he
                speaks: 
 Okay. There’s something we need to find, something hidden here in the
                castle. It could help us defeat You-Know-Who. 
 What is it? 
 We don’t know. 
 Where is it? 
 Don’t know that either. 
 I realize it’s not much to go on. 
 That’s nothing to go on.
 I think it might have something to do with Ravenclaw. It would be
                small, easy to conceal, valuable. Any ideas? 
 Well, there’s Rowena Ravenclaw’s lost diadem. 
 Oh, bloody hell. Here we go. 
 The lost diadem of Ravenclaw? Hasn’t anyone ever heard of it? It’s
                quite famous. 
 Yes, but Luna, it’s lost. For centuries now. There’s not a person alive
                today who’s seen it. 
 Excuse me. But would someone tell me: what’s a bloody diadem? 
 It’s a kind of crown. You know, like a tiara. 
 Ravenclaw’s was rumored to have magical properties, to enhance the
                wisdom of the wearer.
 Harry. 
 Hey there. 
 Six months she hasn’t seen me and it’s like I’m Frankie First Year. I
                mean, I’m only her brother. 
 Got loads of those, though, doesn’t she? There’s only one Harry. 
 Shut up, Seamus. 
 What is it, Ginny? 
 Snape knows. He knows that Harry was spotted in Hogsmeade. 
 Put a smile on, Miss Reynolds. Wouldn’t want me to have to pay
                a visit to Daddy again, would you? 
 Many of you are surely wondering why I have summoned you here at this
                hour. It has come to my attention that earlier this evening... Harry Potter was
                sighted in Hogsmeade.
 I mention this in the hopes that truth will not be supplanted by
                rumor. For myself and a few select members of the staff this comes as little
                surprise. We have, for some time, considered Mr. Potter’s return to Hogwarts to be
                not only possible but inevitable. Consequently, in the past several months and under
                my specific direction, exhaustive defensive strategies have been employed to defeat
                any attempt Mr. Potter might make to breach these walls. But know this. Should
                anyone -- student or staff -- attempt to aid Mr. Potter, that person will be
                punished in a manner consistent with the severity of their transgression. Rest
                assured: So long as I am Headmaster at Hogwarts, Harry Potter will never again step
                foot in this castle.
 Now then. If anyone here has knowledge of Mr. Potter’s movements this
                evening... I invite them to step forward now.
 I think I can help you out with that...
 It would seem that, despite your exhaustive defensive strategies, you
                have a bit of a security problem, Headmaster.
 And I’m afraid it’s rather extensive. 
 How dare you stand where he stood. 
 Tell them how it was that night. Tell then how you looked him in the
                eye, a man who trusted you... and killed him. Tell them!
 Coward! COWARD! And he didn’t even stay to fight! 
 Mr. Potter, do you mind telling me what you’re doing here,
                which, I trust you realize, is an act of complete and utter lunacy? 
 I’m a Gryffindor. 
 I thought it might have something to do with that. 
 All right! Settle down! Settle down! The room quiets. 
 It appears that your Headmaster, to use the common phrase, has
                done a bunk. 
 Potter...
 I know that many of you will want to fight.
                Some of you may even think this wise. But this is folly.
 I wish you no harm. I have greatrespect for
                the students of Hogwarts. I was once one myselfafter all. I ask for but one thing
                and if granted no magical blood shall be spilt... For a moment they stand, hung in
                silence... 
 Give me Harry Potter. Do this and none shall
                be harmed. Give me Harry Potter and I shall leave Hogwarts untouched. Give me Harry
                Potter and you will be rewarded.
 But he’s there! Potter’s there! Someone grab him!
 Students out of bed! Students in the corridors!
 They’re supposed to be out of bed, you blithering idiot! 
 Oh. Sorry, mum. 
Wait! As it turns out, Mr. Filch, your arrival is most opportune.
                If you would, I’d like you to lead Miss Parkinson and the rest of Slytherin House
                from the Hall. 
 Right away. 
 Er, exactly where is it I’d be
                leadin’ em to, mum? 

                
 The dungeons should do. CHEERS rise again and
                McGonagall’s eyes turn on Harry. She rises up to full height, her jaw firm. 
I presume you have a reason for returning, Potter. What is it you
                need? 
 Time. As much as you can give me. 
 Do what you have to do. I’ll secure the castle. 
 Is that possible, Professor? 
 We teachers are rather good at magic, Potter. We’ve even been
                known to turn out a worthwhile witch or wizard on occasion. 

                
 I think it’s time I ask a few of them to take their magic
                beyond the classroom. What d’you think? Harry follows McGonagall’s gaze, sees
                Neville and Ginny conferring with a sprinkling of DA members. 
 I think you’re right. 
 By the way, Potter... 
 It’s good
                to see you. 
 You, too, Professor.
 Let me get this straight, Professor. You’re giving us permission to
                do this? 
 That is correct, Longbottom. 
 To blow it up. Boom. 
 Boom. 
 Wicked. 
 Um... exactly how do you propose we
                do this, Professor? 
 Why don’t you confer with Mr. Finnegan. As I recall, he has a
                particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.
 I can bring ‘er down. 
That’s the spirit. Now off you go.
 You realize, of course, that nothing we do will be able to keep out
                You-Know-Who indefinitely. 
 That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up. 
 That doesn’t mean we can’t hold him up. And his name is
                Voldemort, Filius. You might as well use it. He’s going to try to kill you either
                way.
Piertotum Locomotor! 
 Hogwarts is threatened! Man the boundaries and protect us! Do
                your duty to our school!
 I’ve always wanted to use that spell. Several yards off, Flitwick
                holds his wand aloft, his face grimly determined. Momentarily a “disturbance”
                troubles the atmosphere -- this is powerful stuff -- McGonagall and other Staff
                members step forward to assist, wands raised high. Together, they conjure... 
 Protego Maxima... Finato Duri... Repello Inimicum... 
 Harry, Hermione and I have been thinking. It doesn’t really matter if we
                find the Horcrux.
 What’re you saying? 
 Unless we can destroy it. 
 So we were thinking -
 You were thinking. It’s Ron’s idea. And it’s brilliant. 
 You destroyed Tom Riddle’s Diary with a Basilisk fang, right? Well, we
                know where we might find one, don’t we? 
 Okay. But take this. That way you can find me when you get back. 
 Where are you going? 
 Ravenclaw Common Room. Got to start somewhere.
 Harry! Wait! I need to talk to you! 
 I’m a bit preoccupied right now, Luna. 
 But you won’t find anything where you’re going. You’re wasting your
                time. 
 We’ll talk later, Luna. 
 Harry -
 Later.
 HARRY POTTER! YOU LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!
 Don’t you remember what Cho said about Rowena Ravenclaw’s diadem:
                ‘There’s not a person alive who’s seen it.’
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? We have to talk to someone who’s dead. 
 He’s very impressive, isn’t he? 
 They never learn. Such a pity. Voldemort smiles, as if amused. His
                eyes gleam fiercely. Begin. 
 Bellatrix RAISES HER ARM in signal and the sea of Death Eaters
                settle, poised and waiting. The air goes still... 
 But, my Lord, shouldn’t we wait -Voldemort’s eyes shift, killing
                the remainder of Thicknesse’s sentence before it can escape his throat. Bellatrix’s
                eyes narrow in contempt. Chilled, Thicknesse looks away. Then -- as if burying a
                knife deep in the heart of an enemy... Bellatrix drops her arm. 
 Nice night for it! Harry turns to Luna. Okay, Luna. mind? 
 Who’ve you got in 
 That’s it. I want a charge on each and every
                joist.
 You do know what you’re doing, don’t you, Seamus?
 Blimey.
 Not good. 
 If you’re to find her, you’ll find her down there. 
 Aren’t you coming? 
 No. I think it best if you two talk alone. She’s very shy. Luna exits.
                Harry eyes the shadows ahead. 
 Tell Professor McGonagall Remus and I will handle this
                side of the castle. Yes, sir. 
 As Dean starts off, the grounds beyond and below come INTO VIEW: a sea
                of Death Eaters. Kingsley and Remus stop dead, narrow their eyes. 
 Dean! (as Dean stops) On second thought, tell Professor
                McGonagall we might need one or two more wands this side. Dean nods, continues on,
                merely trading a glance withArthur, Fred and George as they appear, staring in
                stunned disbelief at the deadly throng across the landscape. 
 It’s the quality of one’s conviction that determines success, not the
                number of one’s followers. Lupin stares straight ahead, as does Shacklebolt. 
 Who said that? Me. 
 For the first time, they look at each other, share a fatalistic smile.
                Just then TONKS appears. 
 Speaking of quality. 
 You shouldn’t have. It’s Teddy who needs you. 
 He’ll sleep ‘til dawn and snore like his father. It’s you who needs me
                tonight.
 It’s you... 
 Ha! Ha! 
 Yeah! You and whose army! 
 Woah! Easy up there! 
 Sorry. 
 Ow. 
Take me inside.
 Harry talks in his sleep. Haven’t you noticed? 
 No. Of course not. 
 I’ve never got this far before. I’m scared. 
 Ron looks at her, then hoists himself through. Me too. 
 
 I didn’t expect it to be like this. 
 What did you expect it to be like? Not this. 
 
 You’re the Grey Lady, the ghost ofRavenclaw Tower. 
 I do not answer to that name. 
 I’m sorry. It’s Helena, isn’t it? Helena Ravenclaw. Rowena’s daughter.
                Luna told me. 
 Are you a friend of Luna’s? 
 Yes. She thought you might be able to help me. 
 You seek my mother’s diadem. 
 Yes! That’s right -
 Luna is kind. Unlike so many of the others, but she was wrong. I
                cannot help you. 
 Wait! Please! 
 Many have sought my mother’s diadem. Its powers are legendary... 
 But I don’t care about its powers! Honestly -
 I don’t seek it for myself! You have to believe me! 
 I want to destroy it. 
 That’s what you want, isn’t it, Helena? You want it destroyed. 

                
 She thought I took it to hurt her. 
             But I only wanted to be more like her,
                clever and wise. She wore it so beautifully, but on me... I grew to hate it... the
                pain I felt... the pain I feel even now... 
 I’ll end your pain, Helena. Tell me where it is and I’ll destroy it, I
                swear, on my mother’s memory -
 Another swore to destroy it, many years ago, a strange boy with
                a strange name... 
 Tom Riddle -
 But he lied. 
 He’s lied to many people -
 I know what he’s done! I know who he is! He defiled it! With
                Dark Magic! 
 Yes. That’s right. But I can undo that, Helena. I can destroy it once
                and for all. But only if you tell me where he hid it. You know where he hid it,
                don’t you, Helena? You just have to tell me. Please. 
 Trust me.
 Strange... you remind me of him a bit... 
 It’s here. In the castle. In the place where everything is
                hidden...
If you have to ask, you’ll never know. If you know, you need only
                ask... 
 Thank you...
 Thank you...
 You do it. 
 Yes, you can. 
 Fall inside! Everybody! Fall inside!
 Not good. 
 Ready!? 
 Are you bloody joking?! 
 Oh God -
 He’s good...
 He’s good... 
 Well done, Seamus! 
 Told yeh I’d bring ‘er down. As Neville
                glowers at him, Ginny reaches out, hoists him onto what’s left of the bridge.
                Neville shakes some ASHES from his head and then... GRINS unexpectedly. 
 What? 
 That was kind of exciting. 
 Mad. The both of you. 
 Not good.
 Night-tee night. 
 You let us out of here, you filthy squib!
 Ginny! Neville! You alright? 
 Never better! Feel like I could spit fire! Haven’t seen Luna, have
                you? 
 Luna -- ? 
 I’m mad for her! Think it’s about time I told her, seeing as there’s
                a pretty good chance we’ll both be dead by dawn! 
 I know. 
 Bloody hell. We’ll never find him 
 There he is. 
 What? 
 Brilliant. 
 He vanished. Just now. I saw it. 
 He must’ve gone into the Room of Requirement. It doesn’t show on the
                map, remember? You said so last year. 
 That’s right. I did. 
 Let’s go. 
 Brilliant. 
 Take my hand. 
 Now. 
 Well, well, what brings you here, Potter? 
 I could ask you the same. 
 I virtually lived here last year. Remember? 
 I remember. 
 You have something of mine. I’d like it back. 
 What’s wrong with the one you have? 
 It’s my mother’s. It’s very powerful, but
                it’s not the same. It doesn’t... understand me. 
 Know what
                I mean? Just then, over Draco’s shoulder and several yards beyond, a SHADOW FLICKERS
                (Ron). Harry looks down, notices a DROP of WATER fall from the PANT CUFF, cuts his
                eyes away. He reaches for the wand in his pocket. 
 Easy. 
 Why didn’t you tell her? 
 Bellatrix. You knew it was me. But you didn’t say anything. 
 Give me my wand. 
 No. I don’t think so... 
 Besides, its allegiance is to me now. If you want it, you’ll have to
                win it back. Perhaps even kill me... 
 C’mon, Draco. Don’t be a prat. Just do ’im.
 Avada Kedavra!
 Expelliarmus! 
 Did you see where it went? The diadem! 
 It’s gone! We’ll never -
 Well done. Let’s find Ron and get out of here.
 RUN! Goyle’s set the bloody place on fire! 
 Split up! 
 Do we climb! 
 No, it’ll just follow us! 
 Here! Take one!
 Serves him right. 
 C’mon! This way!
 Wait! What about Malfoy and Blaise! 
 He’s joking, right? Then Harry sees them,
                perched atop a fragile, crumbling tower. Harry whips his broom around and jets
                forth. Ron shakes his head, then jets after, BELLOWING: 
 IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!
 Brilliant. 
 Nagini. Come. 
 You’re bloody well welcome! 
 Prat. Ron looks
                back, to Hermione, and follows her gaze to Harry, who stares into the distance, his
                face still bearing traces of the agony he’s just endured. 
 Ron, you once asked me if I thought he felt it -- Voldemort -- when we
                destroy a Horcrux, when we destroy a piece of his soul. 
 He does. 
 It’s the snake. She’s the last one. The last Horcrux. 
 Where will he take her? 
 Someplace safe. 
 No. He’ll keep her close. 
 Look inside him, Harry. 
 Find out where he is. If we find him, we find the snake. Then we’re one
                step closer to ending this.
 Stop looking at her. She smells your fear. It agitates her. Be
                grateful she’s just eaten. 
 Forgive me, my Lord, but wouldn’t it be more prudent to call
                off this battle and seek the boy yourself? 
 I do not need to seek the boy! Before the night is out, he will
                come to me! Do you understand! 
 Of c-course, my Lord. 
 How do you live with yourself, Lucius? 
 Go. Find Severus. Tell him I need to see him immediately.
 I know where he is. 
 There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan. 
 Thanks. 
 Don’t mention it. 
 NO!
 Why doesn’t it work for me? 
 You have performed extraordinary magic with this wand, my Lord. In the
                last few hours alone -
 No! I am extraordinary! But the wand resists me! 
 There is no wand more powerful. Ollivander himself said it. Tonight,
                when the boy comes to you, it will not fail you, I am sure. It answers to you and
                you only. 
 Does it? 
 My Lord? 
 The wand. Does it truly answer tome? 
 You’re a clever man, Severus. Surely you must know. 
 Where, Severus? Where does its loyalty lie? 
 With you, of course, my Lord. 
 The Elder Wand cannot serve me properly, Severus, because I am not
                its true master. VOLDEMORT 
 The Elder Wand belongs to thewizard who
                killed its last owner. Ollivander was quite explicit about that. You killed
                Dumbledore, Severus. While youlive, the Elder Wand cannot be truly mine. Snape
                stares at Voldemort, then his eyes shift to Nagini, still circling. 
 My Lord -
 You have been a good and faithful servant, Severus.
 But only I can live forever...
 Kill.
 Nagini! Come!
 Take them... 
 Take them!
 Please.
 Give me something! Quickly! A flask! Anything. 
 They are the same... 
 You have your mother’s eyes... 
 He’s gone. The snake too. 
 You have fought valiantly... but in vain. I do
                not wish this. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a terrible waste. I therefore command my forces to
                retreat. In their absence, dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
                    
 Harry Potter, I speak now directly to you. On this night
                you have allowed your friends to die for you rather than face me yourself. There is
                no greater dishonor. Join me in the Forbidden Forest and confront your fate. Should
                you do so I give my word that no other life will be lost on this night. You have one
                hour. If, at the end of that time, you have not given yourself up, then I shall
                punish every last man, woman and child who tries to conceal you from me. The joist
                trembles one last time, then the ambient sounds of the night return. The clouds
                separate, become just clouds. Ron YELLS: 
 Never! Do you hear me! NEVER! 
 Where is everyone? 
 Lily! 
 Come out of there! Now! FADE IN: 
 We’re going home.
 She’s jealous. Because she’s ordinary and you’re special. 
 That’s mean. 
 It’s true. You know so yourself.
 No! Don’t kill me! 
 That wasn’t my intention. 
 Stand up, Severus. I haven’t much time. What message do you bring
                from Lord Voldemort this time? 
 None. I come on my own account. I come with a...
                request. Dumbledore’s eyes flicker briefly with interest. He studies Snape’s fearful
                face. 
 Is this about the Prophecy? 
 Yes. 
 How much did you relay? 
 Only what I heard. But now... he thinks it refers to her. 
 The Prophecy did not refer to a woman. It spoke of a boy born at
                the end of July -
 Yes! But he thinks it’s her son! He intends to hunt them down now! To
                kill them! 
 If she means so much to you, surely Lord Voldemort would spare
                her in exchange for the boy. I have asked. 
 
 You disgust me. You would sacrifice the life of an innocent child
                over a schoolboy crush? 
 She’s more than that! She’s different! Beautiful. Kind. 
 Hide them all. I beg you. 
 And should I do so, what will you give me in return, Severus?
                Anything. 
 You said you would keep her safe! 
 Lily and James put their faith in the wrong person. Rather like
                you, Severus. Snape reels, staring miserably at the SLATE SKY beyond the windows.
                Dumbledore studies him cunningly. 
 The boy survives. Snape’s eyes shift. Regard Dumbledore. 
 He has her eyes. DON’T! 
 
 If you loved Lily Evans, Severus. If you truly loved her. Then
                your way is clear. 
 He doesn’t need protection. The Dark Lord has gone -
 The Dark Lord will return. And the boy will be in terrible danger
                when he does. 
 No one can know. Your word. 
 My word that I shall never reveal the best of you, Severus? If
                you insist. 
 He exhibits no measurable talent. His arrogance rivals even his
                father’s. And he seems to relish his fame. 
 Sometimes we see what we expect to see, Severus. Other teachers
                indicate the boy is modest, likeable and while no prodigy, possesses above-average
                gifts. Personally, I find him rather engaging. 
 You see what you want to see. 
 Perhaps. Oh. Severus. 
 Keep an eye on
                Professor Quirrell, won’t you?
 Why did you put it on? Surely you realized it carried a curse. 
 I was... foolish... greedy... 
 Drink the rest. It will contain the curse to the hand for the time
                being. 
 For the time being? 
 It will spread. 
 How long? 
 Maybe a year. 
 Well, this makes matters much more straightforward. 
 Do not ignore me, Severus. Was it not you who told me of Lord
                Voldemort’s plan to have the Malfoy boy murder me? 
 It is not expected that he will succeed. 
 But should he fail, one would presume the Dark Lord will turn
                to... you. 
 You must agree. 
 Yes. You must be the one to kill me, Severus. It is the only way.
                Only then will the Dark Lord trust you completely. 
 You ask too much. 
 Too much! Nothing I could ask is too
                much. You know what is at stake! You more than anyone! Snape says nothing.
                Dumbledore sits back, painfully studies his hand. 
 There will come a time when HarryPotter must be told something.
                But you must wait until Voldemort is at his most vulnerable. 
 Tell him what? 
 On the night Lord Voldemort went to Godric’s Hollow to kill
                Harry, and Lily Potter cast herself between them, the curse rebounded. When that
                happened, a part of Lord Voldemort’s soul latched itself onto the only living thing
                it could find: Harry himself. 
 There’s a reason Harry can speak with snakes. There’s a reason he
                can look into Lord Voldemort’s mind. A part of Lord Voldemort lives inside him. 
 So when the time comes, the boy must die. 
 Yes. And Voldemort himself must do it. That is essential.
 You’ve kept him alive so that he can die at the proper moment. You’ve
                been raising him like a pig for slaughter. 
 But this is touching, Severus. Don’t tell me you’ve grown to care
                for the boy?
 Expecto Patronum!
 Lily. After all this time? 
 Always... 
 The irony of course, Severus, is that -- in
                the end -- you and the boy desire the same thing...
 Where’ve you been? 
 We thought you’d gone to the forest, we thought you might be -
 I’m going there now. 
 Are you mad! No! 
 It’s... meant to be. 
 Rubbish! You can’t just give yourself up to him -
 What is it, Harry? What is it you know?
 There’s a reason I can... hear them -- the Horcruxes. 
 I think I’ve known for awhile. 
 I think
                you’ve known too. Hermione stands still, miserable. 
 I’ll go with you. I’ll -
 Kill the snake. Kill the snake and then it’s just him. Then it will be
                over. 
 I’ll take him from here. 
 It’s all right. We’re going to get you inside.
 I kept calling. No one came. 
 Don’t worry. I won’t leave you. I promise.
 Once. Twice. Thrice... Harry stands for a
                moment and then, slowly, opens his eyes. Reacts. FOUR PEOPLE stand within the
                Forest: JAMES POTTER, SIRIUS BLACK, REMUS LUPIN and LILY POTTER. Lily eyes him
                lovingly and beckons him forth. As if in a dream, Harry drifts through the trees,
                stops before her. 
 You’ve been so brave, sweetheart. 
 Why are you here? All of you? 
 We never left, dear. 
 Does it hurt? Dying? 
 Quicker than falling asleep. 
 And he will want it to be quick. 
 You’re nearly there, son. 
 I’m sorry. I didn’t want any of you to die for me. And Remus, your
                son... 
 Others will tell him what his mother and father died for. Someday
                he’ll understand... 
 You’ll stay with me? 
 Until the end. 
 He won’t be able to see you? 
 No. We’re here, you see. 
 Stay close to me. 
 Always... 
 No sign of him, my Lord. 
 I thought he would come. I was, it seems... mistaken. 
 You weren’t. 
 HARRY! NO! WHAT’RE YEH DOIN’ ‘ERE! 
 Quiet!
 Harry Potter. The Boy Who Lived. Come to die.
 You cannot help. 
 Harry. You wonderful boy. You brave, brave man. Let us walk. 
 Sir, this, is this... I mean, forgive me, but you are dead, aren’t
                you, sir? 
 Oh, yes. 
 Then... I’m dead too? 
 Ah. That is the question, isn’t it? On the whole I think not. 
 Not? 
 Not. 
 But I didn’t defend myself. I let him kill me. 
 And that will, I think, have made all the difference. I suspect
                you now realize that you and Voldemort have been connected by something other than
                fate since that night in Godric’s Hollow all those years ago, Harry. 
 It’s true, isn’t it, sir? A bit of him lives in me, doesn’t it? 
 Did. It was just destroyed only moments ago by none other than
                Voldemort himself. 
 You were the seventh Horcrux, Harry; the Horcrux he never meant
                to make. 
 And you knew this? That’s why you were certain I wouldn’t die? 
 Certain? No. Little is certain in this world, Harry. Call it an
                educated guess. 
 Professor, is that -- ? 
 Something beyond either of our help. 
 Exactly where are we, sir? 
 I was going to ask you that. Where would you say that we are? 
 It looks like King’s Cross station -- only a lot cleaner. And without
                the trains. 
 King’s Cross! Is that right? Well, this is, as they say, your
                party. 
 Sir, why didn’t you just tell me about the Deathly Hallows? 
 You will have to forgive me, Harry. You see... I didn’t trust
                you.
 I feared that you would make the same mistake I made, that you
                would be intoxicated by the power the Hallows promise their possessor. But I crave
                your pardon, Harry. It’s clear to me now, as it should have been all along, that you
                are the better man. 
 Sir -
 You are the worthy possessor of the Hallows, Harry, not me. I was
                fit to own the Elder Wand, because I took it not for gain, but to save others from
                it. But I took the Stone because I longed to recall someone who has long been at
                peace and for that I paid with my life. 
 You wanted to see Ariana again, didn’t you, sir? 
 Yes. 
 I used the Stone as well, sir, only a little while ago when I entered
                the Forest. I saw my mum and dad, and Sirius and Lupin... 
 True. But ask yourself this: were you calling them? Or were they
                calling you? 

                
 You are the true master of death, Harry,
                because the true master does not seek to run away from death. He accepts that he
                must die, and understands that there are far, far worse things in the living
                world.
 I’ve got to go back, haven’t I? 
 That is up to you. 
 I’ve got a choice? 
 Oh yes. We are in King’s Cross, you say? I think, should you so
                decide, you would be able to, let’s say, board a train. 
 And where would it take me? 
 On. 
 Voldemort’s got the Elder Wand. 
 True. 
 And the snake lives. 
 Yes. 
 And I’ve nothing to kill it with. 
 ‘Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for it.’ 
 I have always prized my ability to turn a phrase -- words are, in
                my not so humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic, capable both of
                inflicting injury and remedying it. But I would --in this case -- amend my original
                statement to this: 
 Help will always be given at
                Hogwarts to those who most deserve it... 
 Assuming
                circumstances in the main are favorable to such an outcome, of course. 
 With all due respect, sir, I think what we need here is a miracle. 
 I’ve never put much stock in miracles, Harry. On the other hand,
                I can attest wholly to the extensive advantages of a related phenomenon. 
 Which would be, sir? 
 Luck.
 Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living and, above all,
                those who live without love. 
 Sir, my mother’s Patronus. It was a doe, wasn’t it? Just like
                Professor Snape’s. Curious, don’t you think? 
 Actually, if I think about it... it doesn’t seem curious at all.
                    
 I’ll be going now, Harry. 
 Professor. 
 Is this real? Or has this been happening inside my head? 
 Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry. But why should
                that mean that it is not real? 

                
 Is he alive...? 
 My lord, let me help you -
 I do not require assistance.
 The boy. Is he dead?
 Is he alive? Draco? 
 Don’t despair, Longbottom. I put you in Gryffindor for good
                reason... 
 Who’s that? Neville turns, sees that Ginny has
                come out onto the broken steps and is staring at the procession. 
 ... Hagrid’s carrying? 
 Neville, who is that? 
 What’s going on here, Neville?
 Behold, Nagini. Our work is done. 
 No... NO! 
 SILENCE! 
 Stupid girl. You cry for that? 
 Tell me. These last few hours -- as
                you collected the dead and tended your wounded -- was he by your side? Voldemort
                surveys the throng, who stand mute. He nods, as if their silence were answer enough. 
 While your hands ran dark with the blood of mothers and sons,
                fathers and daughters, brothers and sisters, his were clasped in prayer -- but it
                was a prayer for one and one only. While you battled courageously, until you could
                no longer will yourself to stand, he had long since fallen to his knees. While you
                cursed me until your voices grew ragged, he begged me for mercy in a voice as meek
                as a child’s.
So do not cry for that. He’s not worthy of your tears. And do not
                despair of his betrayal. You were never in his heart. Not for one single solitary
                beat. 
 Liar!
 Did you not hear me! Harry Potter is dead! From this day forward,
                you put your faith in me or suffer the consequences. HARRY POTTER IS DEAD!
 Now is the time to declare yourself.
 Draco... 
 Draco, don’t be stupid -
 Come, Draco. 
 He saved your life. 
 Well done, Draco. Who will be next? Hm? Come now, don’t be
                shy.
 Well, I must say, I’d hoped for better. Is this truly the best
                Hogwarts has to offer? 
 Who might you be, young man? 
 Neville Longbottom. 
 Well, welcome, Neville. I’m sure we can find a place for you in
                our ranks. 
 Someone has to do the washing. 
 Now, now, Bellatrix. Let’s not underestimate our young friend. By
                stepping forward, he lives to see another day... 
 I’d like to say something.
 Very well, Neville. I’m sure we’d all be fascinated to hear what
                you have to say. 
 It doesn’t matter that Harry is gone.
 Stand down, Neville!
 People die every day. Friends. Family. Yes, we lost Harry tonight.
                But he’s still with us, here - 
 And so is Fred and
                Remus and Tonks and... all of them. They didn’t die in vain. 
 But you will. 
 And you
                and you and you will. 
 And so will you. Because you’re
                wrong. Harry’s heart did beat for us. All of us... 
 This isn’t over.
 Potter!
 Well done, Malfoy! 
 Can’t believe I just said
                that.
 Confringo!
 The snake! We’ve got to kill the snake! 
 Harry! Look out!
 Nagini! With me!
 Leave her!
 I said LEAVE HER!

                
 Now, my sweet. Now.
 Nagini! 
 Die! Die! 
 Why do you live! 
 Because I have something worth living for.
 Confringo!
 NOT MY DAUGHTER, YOU BITCH!
 Come on, granny, give us your best.
 Back off, boys! She’s mine! 
You will never touch my children again! 
 Be thankful we only took one. Besides... 
 It’s not like you don’t have a spare.
 Hermione! 
 Yes! 
 I need to tell you something! 
 I don’t want you to say anything you wouldn’t say if we weren’t
                about to be killed by a giant snake! It’ll just ruin it!
 You were right.
 When you told Professor Snape it was failing you. It will always fail
                you. 
 It belongs to me! I killed Snape! 
 But what if the wand never belonged to him?
                What if the wand’s allegiance was to someone else? Voldemort stares at him.
                Confused. And suddenly, in this moment, it is Harry, beaten and bloody, who seems in
                control. He smiles, then presses even closer, his voice quiet, vaguely taunting: 
 Come on, Tom. Let’s end this the way we started it... 
 Together. 
 What’s the matter with her? 
 There’s more to me than incense and tea leaves, Mr. Finnegan.
            
 I told you: it’s useless to you.
 Not exactly leaving the place better than we found it, are we? 
 Can’t make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. 
 Something my mum used to say. 
 Why didn’t it work for him? The Elder wand. 
 Because it answers to another. 
 When he killed Snape, he thought the wand would become his. But the
                thing is... it never belonged to Snape. 
 It was Draco who disarmed Dumbledore that night on the Astronomy
                Tower. From that moment on, the wand answered to him. Until the other night...
                    
 ... when I disarmed Draco. 
 But that means... 
 It answers to me. 
 What do you reckon we should do with it? 
 We? 
 I’m just saying. That’s the Elder Wand! It’s the most powerful bloody
                wand in the world! With that, we could, we could -
 Well, it wasn’t boring, was it?
 Together?
 Don’t forget to give Professor Longbottom our best.
 Will there really be thestrals pulling the carriages?
 There’s nothing scary about thestrals. They’re gentle things.
                Anyway, you won’t be going up to school in the carriages. You’ll be going in the
                boats, remember?
 Dad? 
 Yes? 
 What if I’m put in Slytherin? 
 Albus Severus Potter. You were named after two Headmasters of
                Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin. And he was probably the bravest man I ever
                knew. 
 But just say I am --
 Then Slytherin House will have gained a wonderful wizard. But
                listen, if it means so much to you, you can choose Gryffindor. The Sorting Hat takes
                your choice into account. 
 Really? 
 Really. 
 Ready? 
 Ready.
