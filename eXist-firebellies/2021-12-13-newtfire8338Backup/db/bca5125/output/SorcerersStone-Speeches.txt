 I should have known you'd be here, Professor McGonagall.
 Are the rumors true, Albus? 

    
 I'm afraid so. The good. And the bad. 
 And the boy? 
 Hagrid's bringing him. 
 You think it ... wise ... to trust Hagrid with something as important as
    this? 
 I would trust Hagrid with my life, Professor. 
 Ev'ning, Professor Dumbledore, sir. Professor McGonagall. 
 No problems, I take it, Hagrid? 
 No sir. Little tyke fell ter sleep as we was flyin' o'er Bristol . 
 Albus, do you really think it best to leave him here; with these people?
    I've been watching them all day. They're the worst sort of Muggles imaginable. They're ... 
 The only family he has. 
 But this boy will be famous. There won't be a child in our world who
    doesn't know his name ... 
 Exactly. It would be enough to turn any boy's head. Famous before he can
    walk and talk. Famous for something he won't even remember. No. He'll be much better off growing
    up away from all that. Until he's ready. 

    
 Up! Now! 
 I said now! 
 There's the birthday boy! Don't you look smart for your trip to the
    zoo. 
 You mind the bacon. And don't dare let it burn. I want
    everything perfect on my Dimplin' s special day . 
 Yes, Aunt Petunia. 
 Bring my coffee, boy. 
 Yes, Uncle Vernon. 
 How many are there? 
 Thirty-six. Counted them myself. 
 Thirty-six. But last year ... last year I had thirty-seven ... 
 Well now, son, some of these are quite a bit bigger than last year- 
 I DON'T CARE HOW BIG THEY ARE! 
 Now, now, here's what we'll do. Today, when we're out, we'll buy you
    two more presents. How's that, popkin? 
 So then I 'll have ... I' ll have ... 
 Thirty-eight, popkin. 
 You just mind that bacon! 
 Yes, Aunt Petunia. 
 Want your money's worth, don't you, tiger. Well, look there. Aunt
    Marge's sent you the Fourth Battalion. 
 This one's lost its head. 
 Well now, son. Remember, we talked about this. They're not meant to
    move ... 
 Bad news. Mrs. Figgs' broken her leg. She can't take him. 
 We could phone Yvonne. 
 Don't be silly. She hates the boy. 
 You could just leave me here. 
 And come back to find the house in ruins? 
 I... Don't... Want... Him... To... Come! He... always... spoils...
    everything! 
 Now, precious, don't cry. He won't spoil anything. What if Mummy buys
    you three more presents. 
 Three? 
 As many as you want, sweetums. 
 I'm warning you now, boy. Any funny business, any at all, and you'll
    have no meals for a week. 
 Make it move. 
 He's asleep. 
 He's boring.Â· Dudley waddles away and the others follow, all but Harry, who
    steps forward and rubs Dudley's nose print from the glass. 
 Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after
    day, watching people press their ugly faces in on you... 
 Can you hear me? 
 It's just, I've never talked to a snake before. Do you, I mean... do you
    talk to people often? 
 So ... you're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there?
    Do you miss your family? 
 I see. That's me as well. I never knew my
    parents either... 
 MUMMY! DAD! COME HERE! You won't what this snake is doing! 
 I swear, I don't know how it happened! One minute the glass was there and then
    it was gone. It was like magic. 
 There's... no ... such... thing... as... magic! 
 Oh, Vernon, look at him. To think in only a week he'll be off to
    Smeltings. 
 Proudest moment of my life. 

    
 Will I have to wear that too? 
 You! Go to Smeltings? Don't be stupid. You'll go to state school, where
    you belong. That there'll be yours, once I'm done dying it. 
 But that's Dudley's old uniform. It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin. 
 Fit you fine enough. Now fetch the post. 
 Marge's ill. Ate a funny whelk ... 
 Dad! Look! Harry's got a letter! 
 That's mine! 
 Yours. Who'd be writing to you-
 I want my letter! 
 I want my stick! 
 Vernon. Look at the address. How could they possibly know where he
    sleeps? You don't think they're watching the house? 
 Watching. Spying. Following us. We both know the dangerous nonsense your
    sister and her husband were mixed up in. 
 But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back. Tell them we don't
    want- 
 No. We'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer... Yes, that's best...
    I'll burn it. 
 NO! I WANT MY LETTER! 
 Fine day, Sunday. Best day of the week in my opinion. Know why I say
    that, Dudley? 

    
 Because there's no post on Sundays. 
 Right you are, Harry! No damn letters today! No sir. Not one blasted
    ... 
 Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly! 
 That does it! We're going away! Far away! Where they can't find us!
    Where they can't get to us! 
 Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he? 
 Make a wish, Harry. 
 Who's there'? I warn you--I'm armed! 
 Er, right. Sorry 'bout that ... 

    
 I'm not Harry. 
 I am. 
 Well now, course yeh are. 
 I demand that you leave at once, sir! You are breaking and entering! 
 Ah, dry up, Dursley, yeh great prune. 
 Anyway, Harry. Got summat fer yeh. 'Fraid I mighta sat on it
    at some point, but 'magine it'll taste all right jus' the same... let's see now... got it here
    somewhere ... 
 Baked it meself, words an' all. 
 Thank you . 
 Well, it's not ev'ry day yer young man turns 'leven. 
 Excuse me, but ... who are you? 
 Blimey, Harry, did yeh never wonder where yer parents learnt it all? 
 Learned what? 
 What? DURSLEY!!! Do yeh mean ter tell me the boy knows nothin? 
 I'm a what? 
 A Wizard. And a thumpin' good 'un, I'd wager, once yeh've been trained up a
    bit. 
 No. You've made a mistake. I ... I can't be a ... wizard. I mean ... I'm just
    ... Harry. Just Harry. 
 Tha' right. Tell me, Harry. Ever make somethin' strange 'appen? When yeh was
    scared maybe. Or angry? 
 'Dear Mr. Potter, We are pleased to inform you that you have been accepted at
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry ... ' 
 He'll not be going, I tell you! We swore when we took him in we'd put a
    stop to that rubbish! 
 You knew? You knew I'm a ... a wizard? 
 Of course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what
    she was? Oh, mother and father were so proud when the letter came. A witch in the family. Isn't
    it wonderful. I was the only one who saw her for what she was ... a freak!
     
 Then she met that Potter and had you. I knew you'd be the same.
    Just as strange, just as abnormal. And then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up
    and we get landed with you- 
 Blown up? You told me my parents died in a car crash. 
 CAR CRASH! A car crash kill Lily and James Potter? It's an outrage! A
    scandal! 
 HE'LL NOT BE GOING, I TELL YOU! 
 An' I s'ppose a great Muggle like yerself is gcin' ter stop him. 
 Muggle? 
 Non-magic folk. 
 This boy's name's
    been down ever since he was born. He's off to the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in
    the world and he'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwart's has ever known, Albus
    Dumbledore-- 
 I will not pay for some crackpot old fool to teach him magic tricks!
     
 NEVER ... INSULT ALBUS ... ... DUMBLEDORE ... IN ... FRONT... OF ... ME!
     
 
    Tha' s curious. Meant ter turn 'im into a complete pig, whole hog an' all. suppose
     be was so much like a pig already, there wasn't much left ter do. Hagrid sees Harry staring in
     awe at the pink umbrella. Er, be grateful if yeh didn't mention that to anyone at Hogwarts.
     Strictly speakin', I'm not allowed ter do magic. 
 Bit
     behind schedule, aren't we? Best be off. Hagrid exits, leaving Harry to consider his sorry
     surroundings. He looks momentarily at a loss, then ... Hagrid pokes his head back in. 'Less o'
     course, yeh'd rather stay. 
 'First year students will require three sets of plain work robes, one plain
    pointed hat for day wear, one pair of dragon-hide gloves...'
 Things these Muggles dream up ... 
 ' ... and the following Set Books: The Standard Book of Spells by Miranda
    Goshawk. One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi by Phyllida Spore ... ' 
 'One wand, one standard Size 2 pewter cauldron and may bring, if they desire,
    either an owl, a cat, or a toad.' 
 Can we find all this in London?
     
 If yeh know where to go. 
 Hagrid! The usual, I presume 
 Good Lord. Is
    this? Can this be him? Bless my soul. It's Harry Potter. 
 Harry P-P-Potter. C-Can't tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you. 
 Professor! Didn't see yeh there. Harry, this Professor Quirrell. He'll be yer
    Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts. 
 F-F-Fearfully f-fascinating subject. NNot that you n-need it, eh,
    P-P-Potter? 
 Yes, well, must get on. Lots ter buy, 
 See? Tol' yeh you was famous. 
 Why am I famous, Hagrid? All those people back there. How is it they know who
    I am? 
 Don' know that I'm the right one ter tell yeh that, Harry. Let's see now ...
    Three up ... Two across ... Right. Stand back now. 
 Seventeen Sickles an ounce for Dragon Liver, can you imagine? They're
    mad! 
 It says brass, Trevor. As such, you will get brass. 
 There it is! The Nimbus Two Thousand! Runs a good twenty times faster than the
    old Comets. Neil Marks himself rides it for the Chudley Cannons. 
 Mind you don't drop your bottle of eel's eye, Belinda. I'll not buy you
    another. 
 Dragon Liver? Do they mean from a real dragon'? 
 Well, they don't mean a ruddy penguin. Crikey, I'd like a dragon. 
 You'd like a dragon'? 
 Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry. Vastly misunderstood ... 

    
 But how am I to pay for all this, Hagrid? I haven't
    any money. 
 There's yer money. Gringotts. Wizard's. Bank. No place safer, Harry. Not one.
    'Cept perhaps Hogwarts. 
 Hagrid, what exactly was that? 
 Yer basic Door Goblin. Clever as they come goblins, but not yer most friendly
    beasts. Best stay close. 
 Mornin'. Mr. Harry Potter
    wishes to make a withdrawal. 
 And Mr. Harry Potter has his key? 
 Let's see, got it 'ere somewhere ... 
 Ah, 'ere' s the li' l devil. 

    There's another matter as well. I've got a letter from Professor Dumbledore. It's about the
    You-Know-What in Vault You-Know-Which. 
 Very well. I'll have Griphook take you. 
 Din' think yer parents would leave yeh with nothin', did yeh? 
 Vault Seven Hundred Thirteen. 
 What's in here, Hagrid? 
 Can't tell yeh that, Harry. Hogwarts business. Very secret. 
 Anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through the door. 
 How often do you check to see if anyone's inside? 
 About once every ten years.
 Best not mention this ter anyone either, Harry. 
 I still need ... a wand. 

    
 Only place for wands, is Ollivanders. You go inside. I got one
    more thing I gotta' do. 

   
 I wondered when I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter. Seems only yesterday your
    mother and father were in here buying their first wands ... 
 Here we are. Just give it a wave.
     
 No. Apparently not. Perhaps
    this. 

   
 No. No. Definitely not. No Matter. After all ... it's the wand that
    chooses the wizard. 
 I wonder... 
 Go on then. 
 Curious. Very curious. 
 Sorry, but what's curious? 
 I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. It so happens that the
    phoenix whose tail feather resides in your wand, gave another feather. Just one other. It's
    curious that you should be destined for this wand when its brother 
 gave you that scar. 
 And who owned that wand? 

   
 We don't speak his name, Harry. 
 As I said, the wand chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter. It's not always clear
    why. But I think it's clear we can expect great things from you. After all,
    He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things. 
 Terrible, yes. But great. 

   
 Happy Birthday, Harry. 

    
 For me? Really? He's Mine? 
 Crikey, yeh'd think yeh hadn't gotten. a birthday present before. 
 I haven't. Not really. 
 You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet. 

    
 He killed my parents, didn't he? The one who gave me this.
    You know, Hagrid. I know you do. 

   
 'Course I know. Who do yeh think carried yeh out o' yer parents' house,
    Hallowe'en night, ten years ago? Who do yeh think brought yeh ter Dumbledore an' watched him lay
    yeh on yer Aunt an' Uncle's doorstep? 'Course I know, Harry. 
 Firs', un'erstand this, 'cause it's important: not all
    yer wizards are good. Some go bad. Years ago, there was this one wizard who weent as bad as you
    could go. His name was... was... 
 Maybe if you wrote it down. 
 Nah--can' spell it. All right-- Voldemort. 
 Voldemort? 
 Dark days those were, Harry. Volde... You-Know-Who... started lookin' fer
    followers. Got 'em too. Anyone that stood up to him ended up dead. Including yer parents. No one
    lived once he decided to kill 'em. Not one. 'Cept you. 
 Me? Voldemort tried to kill me? 
 That's no ord'nary cut on your forehead. A mark like that only comes when
    yeh've been touched by a curse. An evil curse. 
 But what happened to Vol... to You-Know-Who? 
 Some say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. I reckon he's out there
    somewhere, jus' too weak to carry on. But one thing's fer certain, Harry. Somethin' about you
    stumped him that night. That's why you're famous. That's why e'ryone knows yer name.
     
 You
    're the boy who lived. 
 Blimey, look at the time. 'Fraid I 'ave ter be leavin' yeh now, Harry.
    Dumbledore will be wantin' 
 He'll
    be wantin' 'ter see me. 
 That there's yer train. Leaves in
    about ten minutes time. Jus' make sure yeh stick ter yeh ticket. That's very important, Harry.
    Stick ter yeh ticket... 
 There must be something wrong, Hagrid. This says Platform Nine and Three
    Quarters. There's no such thing.
    
 ...Is there?  
 Excuse me. Can you tell me where I might find Platform Nine and
    Three-Quarters. 

    
 Think you're funny, do you? Nine and Three-Quarters indeed...
    Harry looks about, despairingly, then HEARS... 

    
 ...packed with Muggles, of course. 
 All right, Percy. You first.
     
 Fred. You next. 
 I'm not Fred I'm George. Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? 
 Sorry, George. 
 Only joking. I am Fred. 
 Excuse me. Could you tell me-- 
 How to get onto the platform? Not to worry, dear. It's Ron's first time
    to Hogwarts as well. 
 All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier
    between Platforms Nine and Ten. Focus ... but don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash into
    it either. Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous. 
 Gran! I've lost my toad again. 
 Oh, Neville. Honestly. Not again... 
 Go on, Lee. Give us a look. 
 Want a hand? 
 Yes, please. 
 Oy! C'mere, Fred! Take a handle. 
 Thanks very much. 
 Blimey. You're... 
 Harry Potter. 
 What'? Oh, him. Yes. I mean, I am. 
 Fred! George! Come say goodbye to Ginny. Mrs. Weasley stands waving,
    the redheaded girl clinging to her dress. The twins take one last look at Harry, dash off. 
 Have to go, Mother. The other Prefects are expecting me up front. 
 Mum! Guess who's on the train? Right now... 
 Harry Potter! 
 Oh, Mum, can I go on and see him? Please. 
 Certainly not. The boy isn't something you goggle at in a zoo.
     
 All right, on you go, all of what is that on your nose?
     
 You two watch out for your brother. And behave yourselves this year. If I get
    one more owl teeling me you've blown up a toilet or something-- 
 Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up a toilet. 
 Great idea, though, thanks, Mum! 
 Mind? Everywhere else is full. 
 Not at all. 
 I'm Ron, by the way. 
 I heard. I'm Harry. 
 I... heard. 
 Is it true? I mean, have you
    really got the... you know... 
 Wicked. 
 Are all your family wizards? 
 Huh? Oh. I think so. Well, Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant. But we
    never talk about him. I heard you went to live with Mugg1es. What are they like? 
 Horrible. Well, not all of them. Mine are, though. Trade them for three wizard
    brothers any day. 
 Five. I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. Everyone expects me to do
    as well as the others. But if I do, it's no big deal because they did it first. You never get
    anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes. Charlie's old wand. Even
    Scabbers used to be Percy's... 
 Hardly ever wakes up. He's useless basically.
    Percy got an owl for making Prefect, but Mum and Dad couldn't afford-- I mean, I got Scabbers
    instead. 
 Anything off the trolley, dears? 
 We'll take the lot. 
 'Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans'? 
 They mean every flavor. There's chocolate, peppermint... but you can also get
    liver or spinach or tripe. George reckons he had a bogey-flavored one once. 
 These aren't real 'frogs, are they? 

    
 Just a spell. Besides, it's the card you want. Each pack's got a
    Famous Witch or Wizard. Got about 500 myself. Watch it! 
 That's rotten luck.
    They've only got one good jump in them to begin with. 

   
 I've gotten Dumbledore! 
 I've about six of him. Trade you Scabbers though, if you get Agrippa or Ptolemy. 

    
 Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times,
    Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for his
    discovery of the 12 uses of dragon's blood, and his work on alchemy with his partner, Nicolas
    Flamel. Approximately one hundred and fifty years old, Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber
    music, tenpin bowling, and...' 
 One hundred arid fifty years old? 
 Thought he'd be older, did you? 
 No-- I--Hey, he's gone. 
 Well, you can't expect him to hang around all day, can you? 
 It's just, in the Muggle world, people stay put in photos. 
 Really? They don't move at all? Weird! 
 Pathetic, isn't it? Fred gave me a spell that's to turn him yellow. Want
    to see? 
 Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one. 
 Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see then. 
 Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid. fat rat yellow. 
 Are you sure that's a real spell? Well, it's not very good, is it? I've
    only tried a few simple ones myself but they've all worked for me. For example ... 
 Goodness. You're Harry Potter, aren't you? I know all about you, of course. I
    was doing a little recreational reading and you're in Modern Magical History, The Rise and Fall
    of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the 20th Century. 
 Am I? 
 Didn't you know? I'd have found out everything I could if it was me.
     
 Anyway ... Oculus Reparo. 
 There. That's better, isn't it? I'm Hermione
    Granger, by the way. And you are ... ? Â· 

   
 Um... Ron Weasley. 
 Pleasure. Do either of you know what House you'll be in? I'm hoping for
    Gryffindor--I hear Dumbledore himself was in it--but I think I might just die if they put me in
    Slytherin. That was You-Know- Who' s House. Anyway, you two had better change into your robes. I
    expect we'll be arriving soon. You've got dirt on your nose, by the way, did you know? 
 Firs' years! Firs' years over here!
 You there! Don' be trailin' yer fingers in the water. Yeh might find yeh don'
    get 'em all back. 
 Welcome to Hogwarts. In a moment, you will pass through these doors and
    join your classmates, but before you can take your seats,you must be sorted into your Houses.
    They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. While here, your House is, in many
    ways, your family. Your triumphs will earn your House points, while any rule-breaking will lose
    points. At the end of the year, the House with the most is awarded the House Cup, a great honor.
    I hope each of you...
 Trevor! 
 ...will be a credit to whichever House becomes yours. The Sorting Ceremony
    will begin momentarily. 
 How exactly do they sort us? 
 Some kind of test, I think. Fred says it hurts like hell, but I'm sure he was
    joking. At least... I think he was. 
 It's true then, what they were saying on the train. Harry Potter has come to
    Hogwarts. 
 Oh. This is Crabbe
    and Goyle. And my name's Malfoy. Draco Malfoy. 
 Think my name's funny, do you? No need to ask yours. Red hair, freckles,
    and a hand- me-down robe--you must be a Weasley. 
 You'll soon find out
    some wizarding families are better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with
    the wrong sort. I can help you there. 
 I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks. 
 Well, he's rather disagreeable, isn't he? 
 We are ready for you. 
 It' s not real, the ceiling. It's only bewitched to look like the night
    sky. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History. 
 Before we begin, Professor Dumbledore would like to say a few words.
     
 Yes, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!
     
 I hear he's a genius. 
 Oh, you may not think I'm pretty But don't judge on what you see I'll
    eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me. There' s nothing hidden in your head The
    Sorting Hat can't see So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.... 
 When I call your name, you will come forth, put on the hat and be sorted.
     
 Hermione Granger. 
 Oh dear. Here it is, isn't it? The moment. Goodness. What if the hat says
    nothing and we're all just left standing here forever ... 

    
 Mental, that one. I'm telling you. 
 GRYFFINDOR! 
 Draco Malfoy. 
 Slytherin. 
 SLYTHERIN! 

    
 There's not a witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't in
    Slytherin. Draco's father was one of the first to join You-Know-Who when he got power. And one
    of the first to come back when he lost it. 
 Susan Bones. 
 Ouch! 
 Harry? What is it? 
 N-nothing. I'm fine. 
 Hufflepuff! 
 Ronald Weasley. 
 Gryffindor! 
 Harry Potter. 
 If you will, Mr.
    Potter. 
 Hmmm. Difficult. Very Difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad
    mind either. There's talent, oh yes, and a thirst to prove yourself. But where to put you...?
     
 Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure? You could be great, you
    know, it's all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt
    about that... No? Well, if you're sure... better be GRYFFINDOR! 
 I'm half and half. Me dad's a Muggle, Mam's a witch. Bit of a nasty shock for
    him when he found out. 
 Say, Percy. Who's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell? 
 Hm? Oh. Professor Snape. Head of Slytherin House 
 What's he teach? 
 Potions. But everyone knows it's the Dark Arts he fancies. Been after
    Quirrell's job for years. 
 Hello, Sir Nicolas. Have a nice summer? 
 Dismal. What with the Slytherins winning the House Cup six
    years in a row, the Bloody Baron's become unbearable. 
 Then
    again, he's always been unbearable. 
 I know you. You're Nearly Headless Nick. 
 I prefer Sir Nicolas, if you don't mind. 
 Nearly headless? How can you be nearly headless? 
 Like this. 

    
 I think I'm done eating. 
 If I may, I have a few start-of-term notices to announce. First Years
    should note that the Dark Forest is strictly forbidden to all pupils. Also, our caretaker, Mr.
    Filch has asked me to remind you that... 
 ... no magic
    should be used between classes in the corridors. And finally, please note that this year, the
    third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to
    die a most painful death. 
 And now, let us sing the school song! Everyone
    pick their favorite tune and off we go! 

   
 
 Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts Teach us things worth
    knowing Bring back what we've forgot Just do your best, we'll do the rest And learn until our
    brains all rot ... 
 This is the most direct path to the dormitory, except on Fridays, of course,
    when the staircases change. 

   
 Gryffindors, I givee you Peeves, Hogwarts resident poltergeist
 Oooh! Ickle Firsties ! What fun! 

    
 Rather a nuisance, I'm afraid. Ah. Here we are. 
 Password? 
 Caput Draconis. 
 Girls' dormitory to the left. Boys to the right. You'll find your belongings
    have already been brought up. Any questions? 
 Then, goodnight
    all. Oh, and don' t forget. Before retiring, please place all living potion ingredients in your
    cupboards. This includes slugs, fire beetles and cutworms. Sweet dreams... 
 This is Staircase Twelve North, which should take us to Backward Staircase
    Seven--no wait a minute, we're on Backward Staircase Seven... 
 How many staircases are there? 
 One hundred forty-two, though, in A History of Magic, Bathilda Bagshot
    makes unattributed reference to three others. 
 I hate her. 
 Whew! We made it, mate. Can you imagine old McGonagall's face if we were late
    first day out... 
 That was bloody
    brilliant! 
 Thank you for that assessment, Mr. Weasley. But perhaps it might be more
    useful if I transfigured Mr. Potter or yourself into a pocket watch. That way one of you might
    be on time. 
 We got lost. 
 Then perhaps a map. I trust you don't need one to find your seats?
     
 Transfiguration is
    some of the most complex, dangerous and valuable magic you will learn at Hogwarts. Use it
    skillfully and it may, one day, save your life. Make a mistake and you could find yourself with
    a toad's head and a monkey's tail. 
 All right then .. Shall
    we? 
 There will be no foolish wand waving or silly incantations in this class. As
    such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion
    making. However, for those select few... 
 ... who possess the
    predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you
    how to bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to
    Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to... not pay
    attention. 
 Mr. Potter. Our
    new... celebrity. Tell me. What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion
    of wormwood? 
 You
    don't know. Well, let's try again. Where, Mr. Potter, would you look if I told you to find me a
    bezoar? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 And the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane? 
 I don't know, sir. 
 Pity. Clearly fame isn't everything, is it, Mr. Potter. 
 Clearly Hermione knows. It seems a pity not to ask her. 
 Silence! And put your hand down, you silly girl! 
 For your information, Potter, asphodel and
    wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is know as the Draught of the Living Dead. A
    bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons. As
    for monkshood and wolfbane, they are the same plant, which also goes by the name of ... aconite.
     
 Well, why aren't you all copying this down? 
 And Gryffindors. Note,that five points will be
    taken from your House for your classmate's cheek. 
 Eye of rabbit, harp string hum... 
 What's Seamus trying to do to that glass of water? 
 Turn it to rum. Actually managed a weak tea yesterday before it...
     
 Two Knuts says he loses his
    eyebrows by week's end. Ah, mail's here. 
 Hey look! Neville's gotten a Remembrall! 

   
 I've read about those. If the smoke turns red it means you've forgotten
    something. 
 Only problem is... I can't remember what I've forgotten. 
 Hey, Ron. Somebody broke into Gringotts! Listen: 'Believed to be the work of
    Dark wizards or witches unknown, Gringotts goblins, while acknowleging the breach, insist
    nothing was taken. The vault in question had, in fact, been emptied earlier that very same day.'
    That's odd. 
 It's mad. Dad says there are dragons guarding some of the vaults. 
 No. It's just odd... That's the day Hagrid and I were there. 
 Welcome to your first Flying Lesson. Well, what are you all waiting
    for? Everyone step up to a broomstick. Come now. Hurry up. 
 Stick out your
    right hand, over the broom, and say "Up"! 
 Now. Once you've got hold
    of the broom, I want you to mount it. And grip it tight. We don't want you sliding off the end.
     
 Your other right hand, Mr. Finnegan. Goodness, boy, what have
    you done with your eyebrows? 
 Lost 'em, ma'am. 
 Excuse me, Madam Hooch. Given that a few of us have been on sticks for years,
    would it not make sense to separate the expert flyers from... 

    the neophytes? 
 Thank you, Mr. Malfoy, but I'm sure even an expert flyer such as
    yourself can appreciate the benefits of reacquainting oneself with the basics. Your grip, for
    example. It's thumb in, not out. 

    Very well. Now when I blow my whistle, I want each of you to kick off from the ground. Hard.
    Keep your brooms steady, hover for a moment, then lean forward slightly and touch back down. On
    my whistle...Three ... Two ... 
 Mr. Longbottom! Exactly where
    do you think you're going? 
 Come down here this instant! 
 On your broomstick, Longbottom! 

    Broken wrist. Corne on, dear. Up you get. 
 Everyone's to keep
    their feet on the ground while I take Mr. Longbottom to the Hospital Wing. Understand? If I see
    a single broom in the air, the one riding it will find themselves out of Hogwarts before they
    can say 'Quidditch.' 

   
 Did you see his face? Perhaps if the great lump had given this a squeeze, he
    would've remembered to fall on his fat arse. 
 Give it here, Malfoy. 
 No, I think I'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find. How about up a
    tree? 
 What's the matter,
    Potter? A bit beyond your reach? 

   
 Harry! No! You heard what Madame Hooch said. Besides you don't even know
    how to fly. 
 Give it here. Or I'll knock you off that ruddy broom. 
 Is that so? 
 Have it your way, then! 

   
 HAR-RY POT-TER! 
 Chin up, Potter. They might let you stay on as Hagrid's assistant. 
 Excuse me, Professor Quirrell, could I borrow Wood for a moment.
     
 Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood... I've found you a
    Seeker. 
 Seeker! But first years never make the House teams. You must be the youngest
    Quidditch player in- 
 --a century. According to McGonagall. Just then, Fred and George descend. 
 Well done, Harry. Wood's just told us. 
 Fred and George are on the team too. Beaters. 
 Our job to make sure you don't get bloodied up too bad. Can't make any
    promises, of course. Rough game, Quidditch. 
 Brutal. But no one's died in years Someone will vanish occasionally... 
 But they turn up in a month or two. 
 Oh go on, Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game there is. And you'll be great too. 
 I've never even played Quidditch. What if I make a fool of myself? 
 You won't make a fool of yourself. 
 It's in your blood. 
 Harry ... you didn't tell me your father was a Seeker too. 
 I... didn't know. 
 I'm telling you, it's spooky. She knows more about you than you do. 
 Who doesn't? 
 Does anybody feel like ... we shouldn't be here? 
 We're not supposed to be here. This is the Third Floor. It's forbidden. 

    
 Why, though? 
 Because Dumbledore said so. Let's go. 
 Who goes there! 
 Lead me to them, my sweet.... 
 That's it. We' re done for. 
 Oh, move over. Alohomora! 
 Standard Book of Spells. Chapter
    Seven. 
 Chapter Seven? 
 Shhh! Filch is... gone. 
 He probably thinks this door is locked. 
 It was locked. 
 And for good reason... 

   
 What do they think they're doing keeping a thing like that locked up in school? 
 You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see what it was standing on? 
 I wasn't looking at its feet. I was a bit preoccupied with its heads. Or maybe
    you didn't notice. There were three. 
 It was standing on a trapdoor, which means it's not there by accident. It's- 
 Guarding something. 
 That's right. Now, if you don't mind, I think I'll go to bed before either
    of you figures out another clever way to get us killed. Or worse... expelled. 
 Quidditch is easy enough to understand. Each team has seven players: Three
    Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and the Seeker--that' s you. There are three kinds of balls.
    This one's called the Quaffle. 
 The Chasers handle the
    Quaffle and try to put it through one of three hoops. The Keeper--that's me--defends the hoops.
    With me so far? 
 I think so. What's in there? 
 Here. Take this. 
 Not bad, Potter. You'd make a fair Beater.
    Careful now, it's coming back. 

   
 What was that? 
 Bludger. Nasty little buggers. But you're a Seeker. The only ball I want you to
    worry about is... this. 
 I like this ball. 
 You,like it now. Just wait. It's wicked fast and damn near impossible to see. 
 What do I do with it? 
 Catch it. Before the other team's Seeker. You catch this, the game is over. You
    catch this, Potter... we win. 
 Now don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practising.
    Swish and flick. Swish and flick. 
 Wingardium Leviosa. 
 And enunciate! Never forget Wizard Bartiffio, who said 's' instead
    of 'f' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest. 
 WINGARDIUM LEVIOSA! 
 Honestly. You're going to take someone's eye out. Besides, you're saying it
    wrong. It's Levi-ohhhh-sa. NotÂ· Levi-o-saaaah. 
 You do it then, if you're so clever. 
 Wingardium Leviosa. 
 Oh, well done! Everyone see here. Miss Granger's done it! 
 I think we're going to need another feather over here, Professor. 
 It's Levi-ohhhhh-sa. Not Levi-o-saaaah. She's a nightmare, honestly. No wonder
    she hasn't got any friends. 
 I think she heard you. 
 How are you, Potter? All right? 
 Yes, Professor. Fine. 
 I know ... that is, we know... the members of the staff... that this is
    perhaps a difficult night for you. Halloween. Your parents...
 I'm all right, Professor. 
 Very well. 
 Professor... Thank you. 
 You're welcome, Potter. 
 Parvati Patil said she wouldn't come out of the girls' bathroom. Said she's
    been in there all afternoon. Crying. 
 TROLL IN THE DUNGEON! TROLL IN THE DUNGEON!Thought you ought to
     know...
 Everyone will please not panic. Prefects, lead your Houses back to the
    dormitories. Teachers, follow me to the dungeons. 
 How could a troll get in? 
 Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid. Probably Peeves' playing jokes...
     
 What? 
 Hermione. She doesn't know. 
 That's the third floor he's going to. Teachers were supposed to go to the
    dungeons... 
 What's that? 
 Smells like Fred's socks. Only... worse. 
 Follow me.
 Yes! 
 This wouldn't be the girl's bathroom, would it?
 Don't worry, Hermione! We're here! 
 She's
    dead. 
 I heard that! 
 What do we do? 

    
 Confuse it! 
 Confuse it? 
 Hey, pea brain! 

    Wingardium Leviosa. 
 Wingardium LEVI-OHHHH-SA! 
 Is it--dead? 
 I don't think so. Just knocked out. 
 No need to kill it, after all. 
 Yes, well, that was big of you. Ugh. Troll snot. 
 Explain yourselves! Both of you. 
 It's my fault, Professor McGonagall. 
 Miss Granger! 
 I went looking for the troll. I've read about them and thought I could
    handle it. But I was wrong. If Harry and Ron hadn't come along ... I'd be dead. 
 I'm very disappointed in you, Miss Granger. Five points will be taken
    from Gryffindor for your very serious lack of judgement. As for you gentlemen, I hope you
    realize just how lucky you are. Not many First Years could take on a full grown mountain troll
    and live to tell the tale. I award each of you five points... for sheer dumb luck. 
 Good of her to get us out of trouble like that. 
 Mind you, we did save her from a full grown mountain troll. 
 Mind you, she might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked the thing in
    with her. 
 What are friends for? 
 Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on. 
 Ron's right, Harry. You're going to need your strength today. 
 I'm not hungry. 

    
 Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now that you've proven yourself
    against a troll, a little game of Quidditch should be easy work for you. Even if it is against
    my boys. 
 That was ... disturbing. 
 I tell you what's disturbing. Snape smiling. 
 That explains the blood. 
 Blood? 
 Last night, Ron and I saw Snape heading for the third floor. I'm guessing he
    let the troll in as a diversion, tried to get past the three-headed dog, and got himself bit.
    That's why he's limping._ 
 But why would anyone go near that dog? 
 Listen. The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took something out of one of the
    vaults. Said it was Hogwarts business. Very secret. 
 So you're saying... 
 That's what the dog's guarding. That's what Snape wants. 
 But what's safer than Gringotts? 
 One place, according to Hagrid. Hogwarts. 
 Well, whatever it is, it must be really valuable. 
 Or really dangerous. 
 Bit early for mail, isn't it? 
 That's Hedwig. 
 It's a broomstick. 
 That's not a broomstick, Harry. That's a Nimbus Two Thousand. 
 But who...?
 I know what you'ree thinking, Harry. I'm playing my first game of Quidditch,
    the entire school's watching me and, worst of all, it's against Slytherin. Am I right? 
 Pretty close. 
 It' s all right. I felt the same way before my first game. 
 What happened? 
 I don't really remember. I took a Bludger to the head about two minutes in and
    woke up in the hospital week later. 
 Now, I want a nice clean game. From all of you. 
 Who's he, Angelina? 
 Marcus Flint. Slytherin Captain. They say he's got troll blood in him.
     
 Mount your brooms, please. 
 Quaffle's up... and straight off taken by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor.
    What an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive too, I might add... 
 Budge up there. Clear the way.How's Harry holdin' up? 
 He hasn't had much to do yet. 
 First game. He stays outta trouble, that'll be doin' enough. 
 The Snitch!
 FOUL! FOUL! FOUL! 
 Dunno what Harry thinks he's doin'. If I didn't know better, I'd say he's
     lost control of his broom... 
 Maybe something happened to it when Flint blocked him. 
 No. Can't nothin' interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic. No
     kid could do that to a Nimbus 2000. 

     
 It's Snape. He's jinxing the broom. 
 Jinxing the broom? What do we do? 
 Leave it to me. As Hermione dashes off, Ron turns the binoculars back to
     the sky. Harry hangs from the broom with two hands while Fred hovers nearby. George circles
     about ten feet below. 
 What's George doing? 
 Just in case you fall, George will... 
 ... catch you. 
 I knew I should have gone out for football. 
 What's football? 
 Take a good look, lads. With any luck we'll be having Potter soup for supper.
      
 Come on, Hermione...
 Well, that's unfortunate. Understandable, but unfortunate. 
 Unfortunate nothin'. He's got the Snitch! 
 He didn't catch it. He swallowed it!. 

     
 Nothing in the Quidditch rulebook discriminates against catching
     the Snitch in your mouth. Or any other place for that matter. In fact, in a game played in
     Greece in the late seventeenth century- 
 Thank you, Miss Granger. We can dispense with the more unattractive
     historical details of the game. Nevertheless, your point is well taken. Match to Gryffindor!
      

    
 Rubbish! Why would Snape put a curse on Harry's broom? 
 Who knows? Why was he trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween? 
 How do you know about Fluffy? 
 Fluffy? 
 That thing has a name? 
 'Course he's got a name. He's mine. Bought him off an Irish bloke I met in the
    Pub las' year. Lent him to Dumbledore to guard the... 
 Yes? 
 Don' be askin' me anymore. That's top secret, that is. 
 But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding, Snape's trying to steal it. 
 Codswallop! Snape's a Hogwart'steacher. 
 Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid. I've read
    all about them. You've got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking. 
 Now listen to me, all three of yeh-- yer meddlin' in things that shouldn't be
    meddled. It's dangerous. What that dog's guardin' is strictly betw'n Professor Dumbledore and
    Nicolas Flamel--
 Nicolas Flamel. Why does that name sound familiar? 
 Listen up! As the lake is frozen, all students going home for holiday
    will take a flying sleigh to the departure platform. Earmuffs are strongly recommended. 
 Don't send me there! Can't you see his Knight? Send him. We can afford to
    lose him. 
 Queen to pawn six. 
 Oh my god! That' s barbaric ! 
 That's chess. I see you're packed. 
 I see you're not. 
 Change of plans. My parents decided to go to Romania to visit my brother
    Charlie. He's studying dragons there. 
 You can help Harry then. He promised to keep looking in the library for
    Nicolas Flamel over holiday. 
 We have looked. A hundred times. 

    
 Not in the Restricted Section. 
 Happy Christmas, Harry! 
 I've got presents. 
 What'd you expect? In your hand's from Hagrid. And by the looks of that lumpy
    one, Mum's sent you a Weasley sweater. 
 Your father left this in my possession before he died. It is time it was
    returned to you. 
 It's some kind of... cloak. 
 Well let's see then. Put it on. 
 Ahhh! 
 Harry, do you know what this is? It's an invisibility cloak. They're really rare.
    Who gave you this? 
 ...There's no name ... It just says, 'Use it well.' 
 Flamel. Nicolas Flamel...
 Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid's, yet? 
 B-b-but Severus, I- 
 You don't want me as your enemy, Quirrel. 
 I don't know what you- 
 You know perfectly well what I mean. Your little bit of hocus pocus...
     
 We'll have another little
    chat soon, when you've had time to think things over and decide where your loyalties lie.
     
 Professors... I found this. In the Restricted Section. It's still hot. 
 Then they can't be far. 
 Ah! 
 Mum? Dad? 
 Ron! Ron! Wake up! 
 There's something you've got to see! 
 Come look! It's my family. 

    
 That's you, Harry. 
 Look in properly, go on, stand here. 
 There. You see them, don't you? That's- 
 Me. Only I'm... Head Boy! And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup and... bloody
    hell... I'm Quidditch Captain too! Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future? 

    
 How can it? All my family are dead. 
 Want to play chess? 
 No. 
 Want to go visit Hagrid? 
 No. 
 Harry, I know what you're thinking. But don't. There's something not right about
    that mirror. 

     
 Back again, Harry? 
 I see that you--like so many before you--have discovered the delights of
     the Mirror of Erised. I expect by now you realize what it does. 
 It shows me my family. 
 And it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy. 
 I don't need a cloak to become invisible. 
 I'll give you a clue, Harry. The happiest man on earth would look into the
    Mirror of Erised and see only himself, exactly. as he is. 
 So, then, it shows us what we want... Whatever we want... 
 Yes and no. It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most
    desperate desire of our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them gathered around
    you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his family, sees himself standing
    alone. Remember this, though, Harry. This mirror gives us neither knowledge or truth. Men have
    wasted away before it. Even gone mad. 
 That's why it will be moved to a
    new home tomorrow. I ask that you do not go looking for it again, Harry. It does not do to dwell
    on dreams and forget to live. 
 Can I ask you something, Professor? What do you see when you look in the
    Mirror? 
 I? I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks. One can never have
    enough socks, Harry. You'll do well to remember that as well. 
 I'll ask you again. What are the three most crucial ingredients in a
    Forgetfulness Potion? 
 And I'll tell you again. I forgot. 
 And what, may I ask, do you plan to do should you get that question on
    final exams? 
 Crib off you. 
 You will not. Besides, according to Professor McGonagall, we're to be given
    special quills bewitched with an anti-cheating spell. 
 That's insulting. It's as if they don't trust us. 

    Dumbledore again. 
 Leg-Locker Curse. 
 Malfoy.
     
 You've got to start standing up to him, Neville. 
 How? I can't stand up at all. 
 I offered to do the countercurse, but he wouldn't let me. 
 Of course not. That's all I need, you to set my bloody kneecaps on fire. 
 I don't appreciate the insinuation, Longbottom. Besides, if anyone cares to
    notice, my eyebrows have completely grown back. 
 All right then, Neville, who shall it be? Me, Hermione, or... 
 I've found him. 
 He's bowling. So what? He's always bowling. 
 Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the
    dark wizard Grindelwald, for the discovery ofthe twelve uses of dragon's blood... and his work
    on alchemy... with his partner, Nicolas Flamel. 
 I knew the name sounded familiar. I read it on the train that day.
 Follow me. 
 Hey! Wait! What about that counter-curse! Neville's eyes shift. Seamus
    smiles, raises an eyebrow. 
 How could I be so stupid! I checked this out weeks ago for a bit of light
    reading. 
 This is light? 
 Of course! Here it is! 
 Nicolas
    Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone! 
 The what? 
 Oh, honestly, don't you two read? 
 The sorcerer's
    Stone is a legendary substance with astonishing powers. It will transform any metal in to pure
    gold, and produces the Elixir of Life, which will make the drinker immortal. 
 Immortal. 
 It means you'll never die. 
 I know what it means-- 
 The only stone currently in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas Flamel, the
    noted alchemist, who last year celebrated his six hundred and sixty-fifth birthday.
     
 That's what Fluffy's guarding on the Third Floor. That's what's
    under the trapdoor. The Sorcerer's Stone! 
 So Flamel knows someone's after the Stone... gives it to Dumbledore to keep
    safe at Hogwarts ... not realizing that the one who's after it .. . 
 Teaches at Hogwarts. 
 So Snape wants piles of gold and to live forever. Who wouldn't? 
 What is it, Hermione? 
 I don't want to scare you, Harry. It's just ... if all Snape wants is the
    Sorcerer's Stone ... why did he try to kill you that day on the Quidditch pitch? 
 Oh. Hullo. Er... not ter be rude, but I'm not really fit ter entertain right
    about- 
 We know about the Sorcerer's Stone. 
 Snape! Blimey, yer not still on abou' him, are yeh? 
 Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone. We just don't know... why. 
 Harry, Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. He's not
    abou' ter steal it. 
 What? 
 Yeh heard me: Snape was one o' the teachers in on protectin' the Stone. Now,
    as I said, I'm a bit preoccupied at moment-- 
 Wait a minute. One of the teachers? 
 Of course! There are other things defending the Stone, aren't there?
    Spells, enchantments... 
 Tha' right. Bloody waste o' time if yeh ask me. T'ain't no one goin' ter get
    past Fluffy. Not a soul knows how 'cept me an' Dumbledore--
 Hagrid... exactly what is that? 
 Ah. Well. That's ... er ... 
 I know what that is! But Hagrid. How did you ever get one? 
 Won it. Off a stranger in the village. Think he was glad ter be rid of it,
    ter be honest. Blimey...
 Is that... a dragon? 
 That's not just a dragon! That's a Norwegian Ridgeback! My brother Charlie works
    with these in Romania 
 Isn't he' beautiful! Bless 'im, look, he knows 'is Mummy! 
 Hullo, Norbert. 
 Norbert? 
 Well, he's got ter have a name. 
 Needs ter be trained up a bit, o' course.
     
 Hey, you there! 

   
 Malfoy! 
 Hagrid always wanted a dragon. Told me so the first time I ever met him. 
 But it's crazy. And worse, Malfoy knows. 
 I don't Understand. Is that bad?

     
 Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Miss Granger. 

    
 It's bad. 
 As every schoolchild knows, dragon- breeding is against our laws, has
    been ever since the Warlock's Convention of 1709. And for good reason. It's hard to keep the
    Muggles from noticing us if we've got a thirty-foot Ukranian Ironbelly running around the back
    garden. 
 Norwegian Ridgeback. 
 I just meant... in this case... sorry. 
 Personally, I don't care if Hagrid has a Chinese Fireball sitting in his
    kitchen, Mr. Weasley. He answers to Dumbledore. You, on the other hand, answer to me. Nothing--I
    repeat, nothing--gives a student the right to walk about the school at night. Therefore, as
    punishment for your actions, fifty points will be taken. 
 Fifty? 
 Each. And to insure it doesn't happen again, all four of you
    will receive detention. 
 Excuse me, Professor. Perhaps I heard you wrong. I thought you said the four
    of us. 
 Indeed. You see, Mr. Malfoy, noble your intentions, you too were out of
    bed after hours. You will classmates in detention. 
 Don't worry, you three. This'll all blow over. 
 It may take a year or two, but eventually people will start talking to you
    again. 

    
 Well, I for one, see nothing wrong with a reduced social
    life. It'll give us more time to revise for finals. 
 Why bother? Even with Malfoy losing points, Slytherin's a lock for the House
    Cup. And look. Malfoy knows it. 
 He won't be smiling tonight. 

    Haven't you heard? For detention they're taking us into the Dark Forest. 
 A pity they let the old punishments die. Was a time, detention would find you
    all hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons... 
 A sorry lot this, Hagrid. I pity you. 
 Good god, man, you're not still on about that bloody dragon, are
    you? 

    
 Norbert's gone. Dumbledore's sent him off ter Romania
    ter live in a colony. 
 Well, that's good, isn't it? He'll be with his own kind. Better all around,
    don't you think? Especially for Fang. 
 But what if Norbert doesn't like Romania. What if the other dragons are mean
    to him? He's only a baby, after all. 
 A baby that breaths fire. 
 For god's sake, pull yourself together, man. You're going into the Forest,
    after all. Got to have your wits about you. 
 The Forest? But I thought that was just a joke. We can't go in the Forest.
    Students aren't allowed. And there's... werewolves. 

    
 Oh, there's more'n werewolves in those trees, lad. You can be
    sure o' that. 
 Sorry abou' this, Harry. Know it's me that deserves punishin', not you. By all
    rights I should be sittin' in a cell in Azkaban tonight. 
 It's all right Hagrid. Besides, it's not your fault we were out after hours. If
    we hadn't come knocking on your door in the middle of the night-- 
 What's that? 
 The reason we're here. 
 All righ' now, lis'en up. See
    this here? 
 It's unicorn
    blood. I found one dead a few weeks back and two before that first term. This one here's been
    hurt bad by summat. It's our job to find the poor thing. Only one way ter get that done and
    that's ter split inter two parties. Ron, Hermione--yeh'll come with me. Harry, yeh'll go with
    Malfoy. 
 I want Fang then. 
 Fine. But jus' so yeh know. He's a bloody coward. 
 Wait until my father hears about this. This is servant stuff. We should be
    writing lines or... something. 
 If I didn't know better, Draco, I'd say you were scared. 
 You're too stupid to be scared, Potter, growing up with Muggles. If you were
    from a real wizard family, you wouldn't be laughing. 
 I'm not, believe me...
 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
 Harry Potter. You are known to many creatures here. You must leave. The
    forest is not safe at this time. Especially for you. 
 What was that thing you saved me from? 
 Only one who has nothing to lose would commit such a crime. It is a
    monstrous thing to slay a unicorn. The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are
    an inch from death, but at a terrible price. You have slain something so pure that--from the
    moment the blood touches your lips--you will have a half life. A cursed life. 
 But who would choose such a life? 
 Can you think of no one? 
 Do you mean to say that thing that killed the unicorn, that was drinking its
    blood, that was Voldemort! 
 Do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment, Harry Potter? 
 The Sorcerer's Stone. 
 The
    Philosopher's Stone.
 Harry! 
 Oh, it's you, is it, Firenze. I see you've met our Mr. Potter. All right
    there, Harry?
 You mean... You-Know-Who's out there, right now, in the forest! 
 But he's weak. He's living off the unicorns. Don't you see? We had it wrong.
    Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself. He wants the Stone for Voldemort. With the Elixer of
    Life Voldemort will be strong again. He'll... come back. 
 But if he comes back, you don't think he'd try to... kill you? Do you? 
 I think if he'd had the chance, he might have tried to kill me tonight.
     
 And to think I've been worrying about my Potions final. 
 No. We're forgetting one thing. Who's the one wizard Voldemort always
    feared? 
 Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore's around, you're safe,
    Harry. As long as Dumbledore's around...you can't be touched. 
 I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of year exams were frightful. But I found
    that rather enjoyable. Weren't you stunnei:l not to be asked about Elfric the Eager? 
 I'm stunned my head didn't explode. Alright there, Harry? 
 My scar. Keeps... burning. 
 It's happened before... 
 Not like this... 
 No... 
 Harry? 
 Don't you think it's a bit odd, that what Hagrid wants more than anything is a
    dragon? And a stranger turns up who just happens to have one? I mean, how many people wander
    around with dragon eggs in their pocket? Why didn't I see it before? 
 Ne'er saw his face... Kept his hood up. 
 Didn't that strike you as unusual? 
 Yeh meet a lot o' unusual types in the village. Ain't 'xactly usual meself. 
 This stranger, though. talked... You and he must've... 
 He asked what I did, the sorta creatures I look after. Tol' him after Fluffy
    a dragon would be easy. 
 And did he seem interested in Fluffy? 
 Well, yeah. How many three-headed dogs do yeh meet, even if yeh're in the
    trade? So I tells 'im, this stranger, the trick with any beast is ter know what calms 'em. Take
    Fluffy, fer example. Jus' play 'im a bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep-- 
 I shouldn'ta tol' yeh that! Forget I said it!
    Hey! Where yeh goin'! Hey! 
 We have to see Professor Dumbledore. Immediately. 
 I see. Well, I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here. Only moments
    ago, he received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off to London. 
 He's gone? Now? But this is important! This is about... the Sorcerer's
     Stone.
 How do you know-- 
 Someone's going to try and steal it. 
 Nonsense. I don't know how you three found out about the Stone, but I
    assure you it is well protected. Now, run along. 
 That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village. It was Snape. Which means be
    knows how to get past Fluffy. 
 And with Dumbledore gone... 

    
 Good afternoon. 
 Now what would three fine Gryffindors such as yourselves be doing inside on such
    a lovely day? 
 We were just... 
 You want to be careful. People will think you're... up to something. 
 What do we do now? 
 Go through the trapdoor. Tonight. 
 Trevor! Shh! Go! You shouldn't be here! 
 Neither should you. 
 You're sneaking out again, aren't you? 
 Now, Neville, listen... 
 No! I won't let you. You'll get Gryffindor in trouble again. I'll... I'll
    fight you! You were the ones who told me I had to stand up to people! 
 To people. Not us. 
 Neville. I'm really, really sorry about this. 
 Petrificus Totalus! 
 You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant. But scary. 
 Who's there? Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or
    ghostie or wee student beastie? 
 Never mind. 
 That was close.
 Sorry. I get hungry when I'm nervous. 
 Wait a minute. He's... 
 Snoring.
 Suppose we won't be needing this now. Look, its obvious Snape's already got
    past Fluffy. If you two want to go back-- 
 Don't be stupid. 
 We're coming. 
 Right then. All together now. 
 I'll go first. Don't follow until I
    give you a sign. If something... bad happens... get yourselves out-- 

    Does it seem a bit... quiet...to you? 
 The harp... what happened to the--
 Yuck! What's this ruddy stuff-- 
 That was...cool. 
 We must be miles under the school. 
 Lucky this plant thing's here, really. 
 Wo! 
 Wo! 
 Stop moving! Both of you! This is Devil 's Snare! You have to relax. 
 Uh, Hermione, it's a bit difficult to relax... 
 ...given the circumstances. 
 I know, Harry. But you must. If you don 't, it'll only kill you faster. 
 Kill us faster? Oh now I can relax. As they watch, Hermione takes a LONG, SLOW
    BREATH and... is SUCKED beneath the surface... VANISHING. 
 Hermione! 
 What are we going to do now! 
 Just relax. 

    
 Hermione? But how... where? 

    
 Do what I say! 
 I suggest we do what she says. 
 He's not relaxing, is he? 
 Apparently not. 
 Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare. Dances in the dark, delights in the damp...
   
 Is she doing a poem? It's not possible she's doing a poem, is it? 
 It's deadly fun, but will... sulk in the sun! That's it! Light! Devil's
    Snare. hates the light! 
 Lucky we didn't panic. 
 Lucky Hermione pays attention in Herbology. 
 What is that? 
 I don't know... sounds like wings. 
 Curious. I've never seen birds like these... 
 They're not birds... 
 They're keys. And I'll bet one
    of them fits that door. 

   
 Locked. 
 Alohomora! 
 Well, it was worth a try. 

    
 So what do we do? There must be a thousand keys up there... 

    
 We're looking for a big, old-fashioned one--probably silver,
    like the handle. There! That one, see! With the bright blue wings! 
 What's wrong with its wing? 
 The feather's pinched. Probably from Snape catching it before us. 
 Harry? 
 It's... too simple. 
 Oh, go on, Harry. If Snape could catch it on that old CleanSweep, you can. It's
    not for nothing you're the youngest Seeker in a Century. 
 Well,this complicates things a bit. 
 He'll be torn to pieces. 

   
 I don't like this. I don't like this at all.
 Where are we? A graveyard? 
 This is no graveyard... 
 It's a chessboard.
     

   
 But what're we to do? 
 It's obvious, isn't it? We've got to play our way across the room. Excuse me...
    are we meant to join you? 
 Brilliant. 
 Now don't be offended, but neither of you are particularly good at chess- 
 Just tell us what to do. 
 All right. Harry, you take the empty Bishop's square. Hermione--you'll be the
    Queenside castle. As for me... 

    ...I'll be a Knight. 
 What happens now? 
 We play. 
 Ron, you don't suppose this is going to be like real wizard's chess, do
    you? 
 You there... d5 
 Yes, Hemione. I think this is going to be exactly like wizard's chess.
     

    Think...Think... 
 Castle to... c3 
 Wait a minute... 
 She's made the same
    mistake I always make. If I go there, she has to take me, and the Ring is exposed! 
 There's just one problem with that. It's you that has to go on, Harry. I know
    it. Not me. Not Hermione. You. 
 No, Ron... 
 What is it? 
 He's going to sacrifice himself. 
 No. There has to be another way! 
 Do you want to stop Snape from getting the Stone or not! 
 You understand, right, Harry? Once I make my move, the Queen will take me. Then
    you're free to check the King. 
 No! 
 Don't forget we're still playing.
     

    
 Checkmate. 
 If you can, go to the owlery and send
    a message to Dumbledore. Ron's right. I have to go on. 
 You're a great wizard, Harry Potter! You are, you know! 

    
 Not as good as you. 
 Me! Books. And cleverness. There are more important things--friendship and
    bravery and--oh, Harry, be careful! 
 You! 
 No. It can't
    be. Snape... 
 Mm, yes, he does seem the type, doesn't he? So useful Snape. Swooping
    around like an overgrown bat. Next to him, who would suspect p-poorr st- stuttering Professor
    Quirrell? 
 But that day, during the Quidditch match... Snape to kill me. 
 No, dear boy, I tried to kill you. And, trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't
    caught fire and broken my eye contact, I would've succeeded. Even with Severus muttering his
    little countercurse. 
 Snape was trying to save me? 
 Oh, don't misunderstand. He hates you, just as he hated your father when
    they were at Hogwarts together. But he never wanted you dead. Your father, after all, saved his
    life once, long ago. 
 Didn't know?
    Surprising, given how curious you are Potter. I knew you were a danger to me right off.
    Especially after Halloween. 
 You let the Troll in. 
 Yes. I have a way with trolls. Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled. While
    everyone else was running about the dungeons, he went straight to the Third Floor to head me
    off. That three headed dog didn't even manage to bite Snape's leg off properly. He of course,
    never trusted me again. Rarely left me alone.. But he doesn't understand. I am never alone.
    Never... 
 Now what does this mirror do? I see what I desire, I see
    myself holding the Stone. But how do I get it? 

    
 Use the boy. 
 Come here, Potter 

    
 What is it? What do you see? 
 I... I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore. I... I've won the House cup. 

    
 He lies. 
 Tell the truth! What do you see? 

    
 Let me speak to him. 
 Master, you are not strong enough. 

    
 I have strength enough... for this. 

    
 Voldemort. 
 Harry Potter. We meet... again. 
 Yes. You see
    what I've become. Unicorn blood can sustain me, but it cannot give me a body of my own. But
    there is something that can. Something that, conveniently enough... lies in your pocket...
     
 Stop him! 
 Don't be a Â£ool, Harry. Why suffer a horrific death, when you can join
    me... and live. 
 Never! 
 Ah, bravery. Your parents had it too. Tell me, Harry... would you like to
    see your mother and father again? 
 Together, we
    can bring them back. All I ask... is for something in return. 
 That's it, Harry. There is no
    good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it. Together, we'll do
    extraordinary things. Just... give me the Stone. 
 Liar! 
 Kill him! 
 Wh-what is this magic? 
 Fool! Get the Stone! 
 Of Harry. Lying on the floor. The Stone glimmering dully in his
    palm. 
 Good afternoon, Harry. 
 Tokens from your admirers. 
 Admirers? 
 What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is
    a complete secret--so naturally the whole school knows. Your friend Ronald has saved you the
    trouble of opening your chocolate frogs. Though one suspects Agrippa and Ptolemy still elude
    him. 
 Ron was here? Is he all right? What about Hermione-- 
 Fine. Both of them. Madame Pomfrey has explicitly forbidden visitors. But
    I think--with the help of a certain cloak-- they've managed to monitor your progress. 
 But what happened to the-- 
 Relax, dear boy. The Stone has been destroyed. My friend Nicolas and I
    had a little chat and agreed it was best all around. 
 But then, Flamel... he'll die, won't he? 
 He has enough Elixir to set his affairs in order. But, yes, he will die.
    To one as young as you, I'm sure it seems incredible. But to the well-organized mind, death is
    but the next great adventure. 
 But to destroy such a remarkable thing... 
 Yes, yes. As much money and life as one could ever want--the two things
    most human beings would choose above all else. Unfortunately, humans do have a knack for
    choosing precisely those things that are worst for them. 
 How is it I got the Stone, Sir? One minute I was staring in the mirror-- 
 Ah. You see, only a person who wanted to find the Stone--find it, but not
    use it-would be able to get it. One of my more brilliant ideas and, between you and me, that's
    saying something. 
 Does that mean--with the Stone gone, that is--that Voldemort can never come
    back? 
 I'm afraid there are other ways for him to return. And when--if--he does,
    it will take someone willing to fight a losing battle to stop him again. Someone like your
    parents. Someone like you. 

    
 Professor Dumbledore. Voldemort said... if I gave him the Stone, he
    could bring back my...family. Could he have, sir? Really? 
 Some people are like mirrors, Harry. They reflect our most desperate
    desires. We see what they want us to see. As painful as it surely was... you made the right
    choice. 
 Do you know why
    Professor Quirrell couldn't bear to touch you, Harry? It's because of your mother. She
    sacrificed herself for you. And that kind of act leaves a mark. 
 No, this kind of mark cannot be seen. It lives in your very skin. It is the very
    thing someone like Professor Quirrell-full of hatred and greed--cannot understand. Or bear to
    touch. 
 What is it? 
 Love, Harry. Love. 
 Ah! Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to
    come across a vomit flavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've lost my liking for them. But I
    think I'll be safe with a nice toffee. 
 Alas! Ear wax! 
 All right there, Ron? 
 All right. You? 
 All right. Hermione? 
 Never better. 
 D'you think Dumbledore meant for it all to happen'? And for you to do it'?
    Sending you your father's cloak and all? 
 Well,if he did-- I mean--that's terrible. You could have been killed. Come
    to think of it, I could've been killed... 
 I think Dumbledore knows pretty much everything that goes on here. The only
    thing I don't understand is Snape... 
 Professor Snape, Potter. 
 Yes, of course. I was only wondering. Is it true? Did he hate my father? 
 They were not compatible personalities, if that's what you mean. And
    then, of course, your father did something Severus could never forgive. 
 What was that? 
 He saved his life. 
 I suppose he felt it his... obligation ...to look after you this year. 
 Of course! And now that he's squared things, he can hate Harry in peace, right,
    Professor? 
 Hogwarts teachers do not hate their students, Mr. Weasley...
     
 No matter how taxing they may be. 
 I think she's warming up to me. 
 Another year gone! Now as I understand it, the House Cup needs awarding,
    and the points stand thus: In fourth place, Gryffindor, with 312. 
 You'd think saving the bloody school from a Dark Lord would count for something. 
 In third place, Hufflepuff, with 352.In second, Ravenclaw, with 426. And
    in first place, with 472 points... Slytherin House. 
 Yes, well done,
    Slytherin. However, recent events must be taken into account. I have a few last minute points to
    award. 
 First, to Miss
    Hermione Granger, for the cool use of intellect when others were in grave peril... fifty points.
     
 Second, to Mr. Ronald
    Weasley, for the best played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years... fifty points. 
 My youngest brother, you know! 
 Third, to Mr. Harry Potter, for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I
    award Gryffinder House... sixty points.
 Oh my goodness. We've tied Slytherin! 
 And finally... it takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our
    enemies, but even more to stand up to our friends. I therefore award 10 points to Mr. Neville
    Longbottom. 
 Assuming my calculations are correct, I believe a change of
    decoration is in order. 
 Come on now, Harry. 
 Didn' think yeh'd be leavin' without sayin' goodbye, didya? 

    That there's fer you to open on the train. Which seems to be leavin', by the way. 
 Go on now. An'
    Harry? If tha' dolt of a cousin o' yers Dudley gives yeh any grief, yeh can always threaten ter
    give 'im a pair o' ears ter go with that tail of 'is. 
 But Hagrid. We' re not allowed to do magic away from Hogwarts. You know that. 
 I do... 
 But yer cousin don't. 
 Feels strange, doesn't it? To be going home. 
 I'm not going home... Not really.
