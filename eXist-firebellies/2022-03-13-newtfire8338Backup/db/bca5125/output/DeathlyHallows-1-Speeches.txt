 These are dark times, there is no denying. Our world has perhaps
                faced no greater threat than it does today. But I say this to our citizenry: we,
                ever your servants, continue to defend your liberty and repel the forces that would
                seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains strong...

                
 Hermione. Your tea is ready, dear.
 Coming, Mum.
 Don’t you look lovely. All packed? 
 Are you sure these biscuits are sugar-free? 
 Quite sure, dear. See the big bold letters that say ‘SugarFree’?
                Dead giveaway. 
 Mm. Yes. 
 Hello, kitten. Don’t you
                look lovely. 
 Darling, don’t be suspicious the biscuits taste so good, be
                grateful the company’s so clever... Hermione looks away from the screen, studies her
                mother and father. Slowly, she reaches into the tiny bag and withdraws her wand.
                Taking two steps forward, she points it toward the back of their heads. Hand
                trembling, sheSPEAKS, her VOICE barely a WHISPER: 
 Obliviate.
 Goodbye. 
 What are those? 
 Close the door. Ron eases inside and steps to the workbench.
                Mr. Weasley turns the knob on the radio before him. STATIC spits forth, then a VOICE
                comes clear: RADIO 
 ...comes to us this evening from the north of
                England, where a wizard family by the name of Westinburgh were found dead in their
                cellar. While not a member of the Order, Mr. Westinburgh and his wife had, on
                numerous occasions, provided shelter for its members... 
 These are for the Order. So many are on the run now, it helps
                them to stay connected with the rest of us. Know they’re not alone...
 C’mon. Mum’s got dinner ready. 
 Severus. I was beginning to worry you’d lost your way. Come. I’ve
                saved you a seat. 
 You know our hosts, of course, Severus. Narcissa in particular has
                been most hospitable. Lucius, on the other hand, is, I fear, burdened by my
                presence. Are you, Lucius? 
 My lord? 
 Are you burdened? 
 My lord is always welcome here. 
 You bring news I trust, Severus? 
 It will happen Saturday next. At nightfall. 
 And this information comes-- 
 --from the source we discussed. 
 I have heard differently, my lord. Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that
                the Potter boy will not be moved until the thirtieth of this month, the night before
                he turns seventeen. 
 This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in
                the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the
                Ministry. 
 Well, they’ve got that right, then, ‘aven’t they? 
 Pius, what say you? 
 One hears many things, my lord. Whether the truth is among them
                is not clear. 
 Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most
                useful, Pius. Where will he be taken? The boy? 
 To a safehouse. Likely the home of someone in the Order. I’m told it
                has been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be
                impractical to attack him. We may have compromised the Ministry, but there are those
                who remain loyal to him. As long as the Ministry stands, his allies within will have
                the means at their disposal to insure his safety. 
 My lord, if I might, I’d like to volunteer myself for this task.
                I’d like to kill the boy. 
 Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet? 
 Yes, m-my lord. Right away, my lord. 
 As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix, I must be the
                one to kill Harry Potter. But I face an unfortunate complication. It has recently
                come to my attention that my wand and Potter’s share the same core. They are, in
                some ways, twins. We can wound but not fatally harm one another. Which means, if I
                am to kill him... I will have to do it with another’s wand. 
 Come now. Surely one of you would like the honor? What
                about...you, Lucius? 
 I require your wand. 
 Do I detect elm? 
 Yes, my lord. 
 And the core? 
 Dragon -- dragon heartstring. 
 My wand? You can’t possibly thinkI would give you my wand. 
 No, my lord. 
 For those of you who do not know, we are joined tonight by Miss
                Charity Burbage who until recently taught at Hogwarts School ofWitchcraft and
                Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle studies. It is Miss Burbage’s belief that Muggles
                are not so different from us. She would, given her way, have us mate with them. To
                her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination but something to
                be encouraged. I, of course, take a contrary view. But we’re all civilized here. All
                adults. We can agree to disagree. 
 Severus, please. We’re friends... 
 Avada Kedavra! 
 Nagini... Dinner. 

                
 Come now, Dudley. Hurry up! 
 Time for the teary farewell. 
 I’ve lived in this house twenty years. And now -- in a single
                night -- I’m expected to leave. 
 They’ll torture you. Even Dudley. If they think you know where I’m
                going, they’ll stop at noth- 
 You think I don’t know that? You think I don’t know what they’re
                capable of? 
 You didn’t just lose a mother that night in Godric’s Hollow, you
                know. I lost a sister. 
 Do you have any? Magic? 
 What a cruel thing to ask. 
 Well, this is goodbye then, boy. 
 I don’t understand. Isn’t he coming with us? 
 Who? 
 Harry. 
 Absolutely not. 
 Why? 
 Well, because -- he doesn’t want to, do you, boy? 
 Absolutely not. Besides, I’m just a waste of space. Isn’t that right,
                Vernon? Uncle Vernon stares hard at Harry. 
 Come on, Dudley, we’re off. 
 I don’t think you’re a waste of space. 
 Well... thanks. Harry grips Dudley’s hand, then watches his cousin
                turn and lope back across the lawn. 

                
 See you, Big D. 
 Good riddance. 
 All righ’, ‘arry? Yeh look fit. 
 Yeah, he’s ruddy gorgeous. What say we get undercover before someone
                murders him. 
 I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister, Kingsley. 
 You’re more important. Harry grins, then a tall, red-headed man
                    
 is before him, hand extended. His face is
                horriblySCARRED. 
 Hello, Harry. Bill Weasley. 
 Wasn’t always this handsome. 
 Dead ugly. 

                
 True enough. Owe it all to a werewolf by name of
                Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day. 

                
 You are still beautiful to me, William. 
 Just remember, Fleur, once you’re married: Bill takes his steaks on
                the raw side now. 
 My husband, the joker. By the way, wait until you hear the news! Remus
                and I are - 
 All right, all right! You’ll all have time for a cozy catch-up later!
                We’ve got to get the hell out of here and soon! 
 Potter, you’re underage, which means you’ve still got the Trace on
                you. 
 The Trace? 
 You sneeze and the Ministry willk now who wipes your nose. Point is,
                we have to use those means of transport the Trace can’t detect: brooms, thestrals
                and the like. We’ll go in pairs. That way if anyone’s out there waiting for us-- and
                I reckon there will be -- they won’t know which Harry Potter is the real one. 
 The real one...? 
 I believe you’re familiar with this particular brew. 
 No! Absolutely not! 

                
 I told you he’d take it well. 
 If you think I’m going to let people risk their lives for me - 
 Never done that before, have we? 
 This is different. Taking that. Becoming me -- no. 
 Well, none of us really fancy it, mate. 
 Yeah, imagine if something went wrong and we were stuck as scrawny,
                specky gits forever. 
 Everyone here’s of age, Potter, and they’ve all agreed to take the
                risk. 
 Technically, I’ve been coerced. 
 Mundungus Fletcher, Mr. Potter. I’ve always been a
                huge admirer. 
 Nip it, Mundungus! All right, Granger, as discussed. 
 Blimey, Hermione! 
 Straight in here, if you please. 
 For those of you who haven’t taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair
                warning. It tastes like goblin piss. 
 Have a lot of experience with that, do you, Mad-Eye? 
 Just trying to defuse the tension. 
 Wow -- we’re identical! 
 Not yet you aren’t. 
 Don’t have something a bit more sporty, do you? 
 Yes, don’t fancy this color at all. 
 Fancy this: You’re not you, so shut it and strip. 
 You’ll need to change too, Potter. 
 Bill, look away -- I’m ‘ideous. 

                
 I knew Ginny was lying about that tattoo. 

                
 Harry, your eyesight really is awful. 
 Blimey. I almost forgot. 
 Right then. We’ll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.
                As for you, Harry... 
 Yes? 
 The real Harry! Where the devil are you, anyway? 
 Here. 
 You’ll ride with Hagrid. 
 Brought yeh here sixteen years ago when you were barely bigger than a
                Bowtruckle. Seems only righ’ I should be the one ter take yeh away. 
 Yeah, it’s all very touching. Let’s go. 
 Good luck, everyone. On the count of three. One... two --
 Hagrid! We’ve got to help the others! 
 Can’t do it, ‘arry. My job’s ter get you where we’re goin’ safe ‘n
                sound -- Mad-Eye’s orders! 
 What was that? 
 Dragon fire! 
 That’s him! The real one! 
 Hol’ tight, ‘arry! We’ve got ter get yeh out of here! 
 Hagrid... HAGRID...! 
 Avada... 
 Harry! Hagrid! What happened?! Have you seen the others? 
 Is no one back yet? 
 They were on us from the star’, Molly -- the Death Eaters. And
                You-Know-Who as well. 
 Well, thank goodness you two are all right. 
 Haven’t go’ any brandy, have yeh, Molly? Fer medicinal purposes?
                    
 Ron and Tonks should’ve already been back. Dad and Fred as well.
                    
 Oh my God! George! 
 The house! Quickly! 
 My boy! My darling boy! What’ve they done to you?! 
 Remus! What’re you doing! 
 What creature sat in the corner the first time that Harry Potter
                visited my office at Hogwarts! 
 Are you mad...? 
 WHAT CREATURE! 
 A grindylow! 
 We’ve been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I
                had to make sure you weren’t an imposter. 
 Who did this to him? 
 Snape. 
 He’ll be fine, Molly. But
                that’s Dark Magic. The damage is done. 
 Someone else is back. 
 The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us? 
 ‘Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.’ Shacklebolt lowers his
                wand, wheels on Harry. 
 What gave you away? 
 Hedwig -- I think. She was trying to protect me --
 Hey ya -- Well... thanks. 
 Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. Wouldn’t be standing here without
                him. 
 Really? 

                
 Always the tone of surprise. 
 Are we the last? Where’s George? 
 Remus. Where’s my son? 
 How do you feel, Georgie? 
 Saint-like. 
 Come again? 
 Saint-like... You see, I’m holy. Holey, Fred, geddit? 
 With the whole wide world of ear- related humor at your disposal, you
                go for holey? Pathetic. 
 Reckon I’m still better-looking than you. Better-looking thanBill,
                that’s for sure. 
 Mad-Eye’s dead. 
 Mundungus took one look atVoldemort and Disapparated. 
 Mad-Eye reckoned You-Know-Who would expect the real Harry to be with
                the most skilled Auror. He knew he’d be in the most danger. 
 It doesn’t explain how they knew we were moving Harry tonight.
                    
 Wha’? One of us? Tha’s mad. I’d wager me life it wasn’ none of you
                lot. An’ if it was me I’d kno’, wouldn’ I? Talk in me sleep on occasion, I’ll admit,
                but there’s only Fang aroun’ ter hear an’ mostly it’s gibberish an’ besides I’d cut
                me tongue out ‘fore ‘d betray ‘arry e’en in me dreams--
 Wha’s so funny! 
 I trust you with my life, Hagrid. I trust everyone in this room.
                Understood? 
 Understood. 
 ’Ear, ’ear. 
 Better. 

                
 You lied to me, Ollivander! 
 No! No! I believed a different wand would work, I swear! 
 Then explain this! 
 But it makes no sense... 
 Perhaps our friend’s loyalties lie elsewhere, Wormtail. 
 No! There must be a way! I’ll think of something else! 
 I hope so, Ollivander, for your sake. I won’t be so forgiving next
                time... 

                
 Going somewhere? 
 No one else is going to die. Not for me. 
 For you? You think Mad-eye died for you? You think George took that
                curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than
                that. 
 Come with me. Now. 
 And leave Hermione? Are you mad? We wouldn’t last two days without her.
                    
 Don’t tell her I said that. (back to Harry)
                Besides, you’ve still got theTrace on you. And there’s the wedding... 
 Wedding? 
 Bill and Fleur. Mum’s been planning it for months. Only thing that’s
                kept her sane, Ir eckon. She’ll kill me if I miss it. Kill you too. Rather go face
                to face with You-Know-Who if I’m honest. 
 I don’t care about a bloody wedding -- no matter whose it is. I have
                to start searching for the Horcruxes. It’s the only chance we have to beat him. And
                the longer we wait the stronger he gets. 
 Tonight’s not the night, mate. You’d only be doing him a favor. 
 Do you think he knows? 
 I mean, they’re bits of his soul, the Horcruxes. Bits of him. When
                Dumbledore destroyed the ring and you destroyed Tom Riddle’s diary all those years
                ago -- he must’ve felt something right? 
 What I’m saying is, if we do this thing right, if we find the Horcruxes
                and begin to destroy them one by one... 
 Won’t he know he’s being hunted? 

                
 All together now! 
 One. Two. Three! 

                
 Were you going to tell me? 
 Yes. 
 And Ron and Hermione. They’ll not be going back to Hogwarts either?
                    
 I see. 
 Dumbledore didn’t want anyone to know what it is we’re doing. If I
                tell you, I’d be betraying him. 
 Zip me up, will you. 
 Seems silly, doesn’t it? A wedding. Given everything that’s going on. 
 Maybe that’s the best reason to have it. Because of everything that’s
                going on. 
 Morning. 
 How’s it look on your end, boys? 
 Brilliant! 
 Bloody hell, what’s the Minister of Magic doing here? 
 Dunno. But something tells me he didn’t come to give away the bride.
            
 To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister? 
 I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.
                    
 And this would be...? 
 Don’t be coy, Mr. Potter. Mr. Weasley. Would you say you were
                close to your former Headmaster? 
 Dumbledore? And me? I dunno. I reckon I was just another Weasley to him.
                He was always polite -- 
 And you, Miss Granger? How would you characterize your
                relationship? 
 We were friendly, not close like Harry, but -- 
 What’s this all about? 
 This. Despite the fact that neither of your friends appear to
                have been particularly close to their recently deceasedHeadmaster, he saw fit to
                remember them in his will. Now why do you suppose that would be? 
 No idea. 
 Come now, you don’t expect me to believe... 
 ‘Herein is set forth the Last Will and Testament of Albus
                Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley, I leave my
                Deluminator, a device of my own making, in the hope that -- when things seem most
                dark -- it will show him the light.’ 
 Dumbledore left this? For me? Brilliant. Er -- what is it? 
 Wicked. 
 ‘To Miss Hermione Jean Granger, I leave my copy of The Tales of
                Beedle the Bard, in the hope that she will find it entertaining and instructive.’
                    
 Mum used to read me those! The Wizard and the Hopping Pot, Babbitty
                Rabbity and her Cackling Stump... 
 Oh, c’mon! Beedle’s stories are famous! Babbity Rabbitty? No...? 
 ‘To Harry James Potter, I leave the Snitch he caught in his first
                Quidditch match at Hogwarts, as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance and skill.
                    
 That’s it then? 
 Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The Sword of
                Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the Sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore’s to
                give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs... 
 To Harry! It belongs to Harry! It chose him! It came to him in the
                Chamber of Secrets when he most needed it! 
 The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor, Miss
                Granger. That does not make it that wizard’s property. And in any event the current
                whereabouts of the sword are unknown. 
 Excuse me? 
 The sword is missing. 
 I
                won’t pretend to be your friend, Mr. Potter. But I assure you I’m not your enemy. 
 You’ll forgive me, Minister. But 
 Dumbledore said something very
 Where is your guard, sir? 
 I came alone. I don’t really need

                
 We want you to be the godfather. 
 You mean -- But that’s brilliant -- I... don’t know what to say. 
 Say yes. Lupin grins, claps Harry on the shoulder and hikes off into
                the darkness, joining the WIZARDS STANDING GUARD in the garden’s deepest shadows.
                Harry looks back to Tonks, then notices a slight, TUFTY-HAIRED WIZARD 
 sitting alone at a table just beyond her. 
 Hello, Harry! LUNA LOVEGOOD approaches in the company of a cross-eyed
                wizard 
 with shoulder-length white hair the
                texture of candy floss. Both wear robes the color of egg yolk. 
 Oh, I’ve interrupted a deep thought, haven’t I? I can see it growing
                smaller in your eyes. 
 No, ’course not. How are you, Luna? 
 Very well. I was bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. 
 Gnome saliva is enormously beneficial! Xenophilius
                Lovegood. We live just over the hill! 
 Nice to meet you, sir. 
 I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at The Quibbler,
                unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet, fully supported Dumbledore during his
                lifetime and in his death support you just as fully. 
 Come, Daddy. Harry doesn’t want to talk to us right now. He’s just too
                nice to say so. 
 Sir? May I sit down? 
 Mr. Potter! By all means! 
 I found what you wrote in theDaily Prophet very moving, sir. I take it
                you knew Professor Dumbledore well? 
 I certainly knew him the longest, if you don’t count his brother
                Aberforth -- and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth. 
 I never even knew he had a brother, sir. 
 Yes, well, Dumbledore was always very private. Even as a boy. 
 Sir, I was wondering if you’d had much contact with him before he
                died. 
 The occasional owl. Though it was strange... 
 Strange, sir? 
 It was the owls themselves. They often arrived in distress. It
                was clear they’d traveled great distances in some cases. 
 Could you tell me from where they’d come, sir? 
 I’m afraid not. Albus’ messages mostly referenced our days
                together as schoolboys. They were surprisingly intimate. When he did speak of his
                current activities his words would turn elliptical. Still, I sensed he was under
                great stress. Why do you ask? 
 Just curious. I was... close to Professor Dumbledore. 
 Well, he treasured you, Mr. Potter, I can attest to that. I can
                also tell you that when a person passes, it’s only natural to rue the things left
                unsaid, to regret the question never asked. I knew Albus nigh on 100 years, but in
                many ways he will always remain a riddle even to me. 

                
 Don’t despair, Elphias. I’m told he’s been thoroughly unriddled
                byRita Skeeter. In 800 pages no less. 
 That woman is a vulture, Muriel, and you well know it. 
 Someone has to pick the bones to get at the truth. I read your
                obituary, Elphias. Lovely. But you did skate over some of the sticky patches in
                Dumbledore’s life. 
 I’m sorry you think so, Muriel. I assure you I was writing from
                the heart. 
 Yes, well, Rita Skeeter hasn’t made that mistake, I’m sure. Word has
                it someone talked to her, someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. You and I
                both know who that is, Elphias. 
 A monstrous betrayal. I can only conclude the rumors are true
                and that she has become untethered. 
 Who are you talking about? 
 Well, I don’t suppose it’ll be a secret once the book comes out.
                    
 Bathilda Bagshot. 
 Who? 
 Who? Bathilda Bagshot! My god, boy, she’s only the most celebrated
                magical historian of the last century. Don’t they read History of Magic at Hogwarts
                anymore? 
 Oh, right. Slipped my mind... 
 She knew the Dumbledores as well as anyone. She’d have letters,
                perhaps an interesting photograph or two. I’m sure Rita Skeeter would have thought
                it well worth a trip to Godric’s Hollow to take a peek into that old bird’s rattled
                cage. 
 Godric’s Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives in Godric’s Hollow? 
 For years now. That’s where she first met Dumbledore. 
 Excuse me? You don’t mean to say Dumbledore lived there too? 
 Of course. The family moved thereafter his father killed those three
                Muggles. It was quite the scandal. 
 Honestly, my boy, are
                you sure you knew him at all? 
 The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are
                coming... 
 Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter! 
 Ron! Ron! 
 Harry! Go! Go! 
 Where are we? 
 Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come here to the theater with my mum
                and dad. Just popped into my head. I don’t know why... 
 This way! 
 We need to change. 
 How the ruddy - 
 Undetectable Extension Charm. 
 You’re amazing, you are. 
 Always the tone of surprise. 
 That’ll be the books. 
 Do you reckon everyone’s alright at the wedding? Maybe we should - 
 They were after you, mate. We’d just put everyone in danger going back. 
 Ron’s right. Cappuccino, please. 
 What she said. 
 Same. 
 Wicked scar. 

                
 So where do we go from here? The Leaky Cauldron? 
 Too dangerous. If Voldemort’s taken over the Ministry, none of the
                old places are safe. 
 My rucksack. With all my things. I left it back at the Burrow -
 You’re joking. 
 I’ve had the essentials packed for days. Just in case. 
 By the way -- these jeans? Not my favorite. Bit tight. 
 DOWN! 
 Stupefy! 
 Expulsio! 
 Petrificus Totalus! 
 Go. 
 Lock the door, get the lights. 
 This one’s name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night
                Snape killed Dumbledore. 
 This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters. 
 So what do we do with you, huh? Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn’t
                you? 
 Suppose it’s him that did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then? 
 It’s better we wipe their memories. We kill them, they’ll know we were
                here. 
 You’re the boss. 
 Hermione? 
 You’re the best with spells. 
 Obliviate. 
 How is it they knew we were there? 
 Maybe you still have the Trace on you. 
 Can’t be. The Trace breaks at seventeen. It’s Wizarding law. 
 What? 
 We didn’t celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I -- we’d
                prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding... 
 Hermione. I appreciate the thought -- honestly. But given that we were
                almost killed by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago... 
 Right. Perspective. 
 We’ve got to get off the streets, get somewhere safe. 
 I have an idea. 

                
 Severus Snape? 
 Mad-Eye...? 
 What was that about? 
 Mad-eye’s doing, I’d guess. In case Snape decided to come snooping.
                    
 Homenum revelio. 
 It’s a spell to reveal human presence. 
 We’re alone. 

                
 Lumos. 

                
 Dear Sirius. Thank you for Harry’s birthday
                present. You’d think he’d been born on a broom. James says he’s got the look of
                aSeeker, but then James would. We had a very quiet birthday tea, just us and old
                Bathilda, who dotes on Harry. Wormy dropped by late in the day, but seemed down and
                didn’t stay long. James is frustrated being shut up here, but Dumbledore’s still got
                hisInvisibility Cloak, so he doesn’t have much choice. By the way, Bathilda tells
                the most amazing stories about our old Headmaster. I don’t know how much to believe.
                Can it really be true that Dumbledore -

                
 Harry! Harry! 
 Ron! I’ve found him! Good! git! 

                
 Tell him from me he’s a 
 Harry, you can’t just disappear. We thought -
 It’s from your Mum. To Sirius. Bathilda Bagshot...? 
 Yeah. They knew her. She wrote A History of Magic, you know. 

                
 Did she now? 
 I’m thinking maybe we should go talk to her. She still lives in
                Godric’s Hollow. I’m thinking maybe she could help us. 
 Harry. I can imagine why you’d want to go there, but... I don’t
                think Bathilda Bagshot is going to know where Voldemort hid his Horcruxes. 

                
 Hey! I think you two better comedown here. 
 The two clinging to the tree areDeath Eaters for sure. Dunno ‘bout the
                bloke on the bench. 
 Can’t see us, of course. But
                we’ll have to be careful coming and going. C’mon. There’s something else you need to
                see. 
 Lovely. 
 Regulus Arcturus Black...? 
 R... A... B. 
 To the Dark Lord. I know I will be dead long before you read this... I
                have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it... 
 R.A.B. was Sirius’ brother? We see the trio from the strange LOW POV
                again, sitting round the kitchen table. SLOPPY STACKS of OLD DAILY PROPHETS surround
                them. 
 Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux? 

                
 Stop! I order you! 
 Kreacher... 
 Been spying on us, have you? 
 Kreacher has been... watching. Kreacher always watches. 
 Maybe he knows. 
 Ever seen this before? 
 Kreacher, I own this place. Sirius left it to me. Which means I own
                you too. 
 That was Master Regulus’ locket. 
 That’s right. But there were two, weren’t there? 
 Where’s the other one? 
 Kreacher doesn’t know where the other locket is. 
 But was it here? Did you ever see it? 
 Filthy Mudblood -- The Death Eaters will soon be coming for you!
                    

                
 Blood-traitor Weasley - 
 Ron! RON! 
 Answer her. 
 Yes. It was here, in this house. A most evil object... 
 How do you mean? 
 Before he died, Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to destroy it. It
                was the last thing he asked of Kreacher. But no matter how Kreacher tried, he could
                not.. 
 Where is it now? Did someone take it, Kreacher? 

                
 He came in the night. He took many things, including the
                locket. 
 Who, Kreacher? Who was it? 
 Mundungus. Mundungus Fletcher. 
 Find him. 
 As your new Minister for Magic, I promise to restore this temple
                of tolerance to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today, each employee will be
                required to submit themselves for evaluation. But know this: You have nothing to
                fear... as long as you have nothing to hide... As Thicknesse smiles, a GANG of DARK
                WIZARDS 
 emerge into the atrium, pushing a BLOODIED MAN
                before them. The crowd STIRS uneasily and we... 
 My father will hear about this. 
 He’s not here, you fools. 
 They have flesh memories. 

            
 Snitches. They’re never touched by bare skin until the Seeker
                captures it. Even the wizard who fabricates it wears gloves. That way, if there’s a
                dispute, the Snitch can identify who first touched it. 
 You mean... it remembers me? 

                
 When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open
                at your touch -- that Dumbledore had hidden something in it. 
 Harry Potter! So long it’s been -
 Expelliarmus! 
 As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief Mundungus
                Fletcher! 
 Dobby has also returned with the thief Mundungus Fletcher! 
 What are you playing at -- setting a pair of bleedin’ ‘ouse-elves
                on me! 
 Dobby was only trying to help! Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley,
                which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry
                Potter’s name, which Dobby thought was very curious. And then Dobby saw that
                Kreacher was talking to the thief Mundungus Fletcher, which Dobby thought was very,
                very - 
 I’m no thief, you foul little git. I’m a purveyer of rare and
                wondrous objects - 
 You’re a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it. 
 Master Weasley! So good to see you again! 
 Wicked trainers. 
 Listen, I panicked that night, all right? I never volunteered to
                die for you, mate. Can I help it ifMad-Eye fell off his broom - 
 Stop lying! 
 Piece of advice. Let’s not rehash old times. Got it... mate? 
 When you turned this place over -- don’t deny it! --you found a
                locket, am I right? 
 Why? Was it valuable? 
 You’ve still got it. 
 No. He’s worried he should have got more money for it. 
 Wouldn’t be difficult, would it? Bleedin’ gave it away, din’ I?
                There I was, pitching me wares in Diagon Alley when some ministry hag comes up and
                asks to see my license. Says she’s of a mind to lock me up and would’ve, too, she
                hadn’ taken a fancy to that locket. 
 Who was she? This witch? 
 Well, she’s right there, in’t she? Bleedin’ bow an’ all. 
 Right.So let’s do it. Who gets who? * 
 Well, unless one of you fancies wearing a skirt... 
 Remember what we said. Keep your eyes down. Don’t speak to anyone
                unless absolutely necessary. Act as normal as possible. Just do what you see
                everyone else doing. We do that -- and with a bit of luck -- we get ourselves
                inside. And then... Ron 
 It gets really tricky. 
 Correct. 
 This is completely mental. 
 Completely, utterly, without question. 
 The world’s mental. Come on, drink up. We’ve got a Horcrux to find.
            
 In case you’re interested, I’m Reg Cattermole, Magical
                Maintenance Department. 
 Mafalda Hopkirk, assistant in the Improper Use of
                Magic Office. 
 I’m nobody. 
 You’re somebody. Be careful. 
 Morning, Reg! Good luck today. 
 Oh... yeah. Thanks. 
 What do you reckon he meant by ‘Good luck.’? 
 We flush ourselves in? 
 Apparently so. 
 That’s bloody disgusting. 
 Are those...? 

                
 Muggles. In their rightful place. 
 Move it, will you -- oh, Runcorn! Forgive me... 
 You appear to be quite popular. 
 I gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit. 
 The Ministry must be hiring young these days. 
 hey’re not Ministry. They’reSnatchers. They hunt
                Muggle-borns and blood-traitors for a price. 
 How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice Potion
                would last, Hermione? 
 I didn’t. 
 Cattermole! 
 It’s still raining in my office. Two days now. 
 Really? Have you tried an umbrella? 
 You do realize I'm on my way downstairs, don’t you, Cattermole? 
 Downstairs...? 
 To interrogate your wife! If my wife’s blood status were in doubt and
                the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement needed a job doing, I think
                I’d make it a priority. You’ve got one hour. 
 Oh my god. What am I going to do? My wife’s all alone
                downstairs? 
 Ron. You don’t have a wife. 
 Oh. Right. 
 Look, we’ll go with you -- 
 No, that’s mad. You two find Umbridge. I’ll be fine. But
                how do I stop it raining? 
 Try Finite Incantatem. Of course if something’s gone
                wrong with an Atmospheric Charm -- 

                
 Level Two. Department of MagicalLaw Enforcement, including
                Wizengamot Administration Services, Auror Headquarters and Improper Use of Magic
                Department. 
 This is you. 
 Finite Incantatem, okay. And if that doesn’t work...?
                    
 I don’t like him being on his own down there. 
 Ron’s been coming here since he was two years old. It’s
                us you should be worrying about. 
 You really have horrible teeth, you know that. 

                
 Level One. Minister of Magic and Support Staff... 

                
 I say if we don’t locate Umbridge within the hour,
                we go find Ron and come back another day. Deal? The grilles clang open again and
                Harry and Hermione freeze. 
 Ah, Mafalda! Travers sent you, did he? Good. We’ll go straight
                down. 
 Albert, aren’t you getting out? 

                
 Weasley! 
 They’re waiting for your report downstairs. 
 Oh, yes... of course. 
 Reckon the old hag will be interrogating Mudbloods all day? 
 Sh...careful. 
 Runcorn. 
 Accio locket. 

                
 All right, all right. Let’s calm down, shall we? 
 It probably just snuck up here from Experimental Charms. I
                think none of us will soon forget last month’s Poisonous Duck... Seeing the
                Red-Haired Witch’s expression, the Balding Wizard turns and, as before, withers at
                the sight of Harry. 
 R-Runcorn. 
 M-morning. 
 Ron, it’s me. 
 Harry! Blimey, I forgot what you looked like. Where’s
                Hermione? 
 She went down to the courtrooms with Umbridge -- The
                grilles open again and reveal... Arthur Weasley, in the company of an elderly witch
                    
. 
 I understand, Wakinda, but I can’t be a party to that. 
 Hello, Reg. Isn’t Mary in for questioning today? Try to have
                faith. If there’s anything Molly and I can do for you --
 Let me guess. It’s raining in Yaxley’s office again? 
 Tell him to try an umbrella. 
 Arthur! You know you’re being tracked, don’t you?
                    
 Is that a threat, Runcorn? 
 No, Arthur. It’s a fact. They’re watching you. 
 I’ll tell you later. Let’s find Hermione. 
 Bloody cold down here. 
 I’m half-blood, I tell you! My father was a wizard! Look him up!
                William Alderton! He worked here for thirty years... 
 What is it? 
 It’s here... 
 Reg... 
 Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? 
 Yes. 
 Mother to Maisie, Ellie andAlfred? Wife to Reginald? 
 Yes. 
 A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today,
                Mrs. Cattermole. Is this that wand? 
 Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took
                this wand. 
 But I didn’t take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at
                Ollivander’s, when I was eleven. It chose me. 
 No, no, I don’t think so, Mrs. Cattermole. Wands only choose
                witches. And you are not a witch. 
 But I am! Tell them, Reg! Tell them what I am! 
 What the devil are you doing, Albert? 
 You’re lying. And one mustn’t tell lies, Dolores...
                Stupefy! 
 EXPECTO PATRONUM! 
 Relashio! 
 You? It’s you! Reg, it’s HarryPotter! 
 ‘Tis, isn’t it? This’ll be one to tell the kids. 
 Harry Potter...? 
 Harry Potter. 
 Harry... they’ve seen you. We’ve got to get out of here. 
 Mary. Go home. Get the kids. I’ll... I’ll meet you there.
                We have to get out the country, understand? 
 Mary! Do as I say! 
 I’m sorry. It’s just -
 MARY! 
 Long story. Nice meeting you. 
 Piss off. 
 Seal the exits! Now! 
 Harry, quickly, in my bag, there’s a small bottle labeled ‘Essence
                of Dittany.’ 
 Quickly! 
 Accio Dittany. 
 Unstopper it. 
 Hermione. His arm - 
 Just do it! 
 What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place. 
 We were. We were there. But Yaxley had hold of me. I knew we
                couldn’t stay once he’d seen, so when he let go I brought us here. Ron got
                Splinched. I’m... sorry. 
 Don’t be stupid. 
 It’s all I feel safe doing. 
 Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... 
 What’re you doing? 
 Protective enchantments. I don’t fancy another visit like we had
                onShaftesbury Avenue, do you? Especially with Ron like this. You can get going on
                the tent... 
 Tent? Where am I supposed to find -
 Repello Muggletum... Muffliato... 
 How’re the mushrooms? Seem to be the only edible things growing
                round here. 
 They’re great. 
 Make sure to leave some for Ron. 

                
 No problem. 
 How bad is he? 
 He’ll be alright in a few days. Hopefully. If we could take him to
                Hogwarts, to Madam Pomfrey -
 So where do we go next? 
 Dumbledore had a theory. He felt that the Horcruxes would not be made
                out of random objects. And he felt they wouldn’t be hidden randomly either. We know
                of three so far. The ring, which according to Dumbledore belonged to TomRiddle’s
                grandfather. The diary, which belonged to Tom himself. And this, which -- again,
                according to Dumbledore -- belonged to his mother. 
 It scares me a bit, that, thinking it’s a piece of Vol- 
 No, don’t! Don’t say it! 
 It’s taboo -- You-Know-Who’s name. That’s how they track people now.
                It’s how they found us in the cafe that night. 
 How d’you know? 
 I overheard a bloke from the Enforcement office talking about it at the
                Ministry. Blimey, what’s that smell? 

                
 Dinner? 
 Not bloody likely. Smells like something Ginny would cook. 
 Tea? 
 Is that it? 
 I know. I felt it too. 
 It’s... it’s
                like it’s ticking or something, like it has a tiny metal heart, like it’s - 
 ... alive. 
 I hate it. It’s like he’s here with us. 
 That’s why we’re going to kill it. 
 Dissendium! 
 Incendio! 
 Expulso! 
 Confringo! 
 It’s angry. 
 What’re you doing? 
 We have to keep it safe until we can figure out how to destroy it. 
 I can put it in my bag - 
 No. 
 Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off to find a load of
                Horcruxes, but doesn’t bother to tell you how to destroy them. Doesn’t that bother
                you? 

                
 Tell me, Gregorovitch. Tell me where it is... 
 I told you! I no longer have it! It was stolen from me! Many
                years ago! 
 You wouldn’t be lying to me, would you, Gregorovitch? Because, I
                must tell you... that will only make it worse for you...

                
 I speak the truth! I remember like it was yesterday... 
 Who was he? The thief? 
 Just a boy! Not of the village. It was he who took it. I never
                saw it again. I swear on my life. 
 I believe you... 
 I thought it had stopped. 
 You can’t let him in, Harry. Dumbledore himself said it. You have
                to close your mind. It’s too dangerous - 
 It’s not a candle I can blow out, Hermione. It always burns, even if
                it’s just a flicker. Can you understand that? 
 Tell me. What you saw. 
 He’s found him. Vol-
 You-Know-Who. He’s found 
 The wandmaker? 
 Yes. How’d you know? 
 Viktor got his wand from Gregorovitch. Most Durmstrang students did
                at one time. What’s he got to do with You-Know-Who? 
 You-Know-Who wants something Gregorovitch once had -- dunno what. But
                he’s desperate to have it. It’s as if his life depends on it. 
 Don’t -- It... comforts him. 
 Well it sets my teeth on edge. What’s he expecting to hear? Good news? 
 I think he just hopes he doesn’t hear bad news. It gets him through
                the day. 
 And what gets you through the day? 
 We’ve all made sacrifices, Harry. 
 How long before he can travel? 
 I don’t know. It takes time. I’m doing all I can. 
 You’re not doing enough. 
 Take it off. 
 Take it off. Now. 
 Better? 
 Loads. 
 It’s cold. Even though it’s been lying against your skin for days.
                    
 We’ll take turns. Okay? 

                
 ... Severus Snape, newly appointed Headmaster of Hogwarts...
                    

                
 What’s that? That... smell? 

                
 Snatchers. 
 Good to know your enchantments work. 
 He could smell it. My perfume. 
 We have to leave. We’re not safe 
 I told you. Ron’s not strong
 Then we’ll go by foot. 
 I’m hungry. 
 What? 
 I’m hungry. 

            
 We’re all hungry. 
 Leave it. 
 Mum can make food appear out ofthin air. 

                
 No one can conjure food out ofthin air. Food is the first of
                the five Principal Exceptions toGamp’s Law. The other four are - 

                
 Oh, speak English, can’t you? 
 I said leave it. 
 It’ll be dark soon. We need to find a place to sleep. 
 Good plan. 
 Yeah. Brilliant. Only, correct me if I’m wrong... wasn’t that
                yesterday’s plan? And the day before that? And the day before that? Walk. Sleep.
                Walk. Sleep. 
 My turn. 
 He doesn’t know what he’s doing, does he? A frown creases Hermione’s
                forehead as she studies Ron, then she glances at Harry, a trace of doubt in her
                eyes. 
 None of us do. 
 Wizards were here. 
 I don’t like this place. Harry and Ron both turn, look at her. 
 I want to go. 
 Oh my god... 

                
 What? 
 I’ll tell you in a minute. 
 Maybe you could tell me now. 
 Alright. The Sword of Gryffindor? It’s Goblin made. 
 Brilliant. 
 You don’t understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade.
                    
 O-kay. 
 Harry. You already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle’s diary
                -- in the Chamber of Secrets. 
 With a basilisk fang. If you tell me you’ve got one of those in that
                bloody beaded bag of yours - 
 Don’t you see! In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the basilisk
                with the Sword of Gryffindor. Its blade is impregnated with basilisk venom. 
 It only takes in that which makes it stronger... 
 Exactly! Which means... 
 ...it can destroy Horcruxes. 
 Which is why Dumbledore left it to you in his will. 
 You’re brilliant, Hermione. Truly. 
 Actually, I’m highly logical, which allows me to look past the
                extraneous detail and perceive clearly that which others overlook. 
 There’s only one problem... 
 The sword was stolen. 
 Yeah, I’m still here. But you two carry on. Don’t let me spoil your fun.
                    
 What’s the problem? 
 Problem? There’s no problem. Not according to you, anyway. 
 Look, don’t be shy. If you’ve got something to say, spit it out.
                    
 All right, I’ll spit it out. Don’t expect me to skip up and down because
                now there’s some other damn thing we’ve got to find. 

                
 Ron... 
 I thought you knew what you signed up for. 
 Yeah, I thought I did too. 
 I don’t understand. What part of this isn’t living up to your
                expectations? Did you think we’d be staying in five-star hotels? Finding a Horcrux
                every other day? Did you think you’d be back toMummy by Christmas? 
 No, I just reckoned after all this time, we’d have actually achieved
                something. I reckoned you knew what you were doing. I reckoned Dumbledore had told
                you something worthwhile! I reckoned you had a plan! 
 I’ve told you everything Dumbledore told me! And in case you haven’t
                noticed, we’ve found a Horcrux! 
 Yeah, and we’re about as near getting rid of it as we are to finding the
                rest of them, aren’t we! 
 Take it off, Ron. Please take it off. You wouldn’t be talking like
                this if you hadn’t been wearing it all day - 
 Yeah, he would. D’you think I haven’t noticed the two of you
                whispering behind my back? D’you think I haven’t guessed what you were thinking? 
 Harry, we weren’t - 
 Don’t lie! You said it, too, you said you were disappointed - 
 I didn’t! Not like that! Harry -- I didn’t! 
 Do you know why I listen to that radio, every night? Do you! To make
                sure I don’t hear Ginny’s name or Fred or George or Mum or - 
 You think I don’t listen! You think I don’t know what it’s like - 
 NO! YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT IT’S LIKE! YOUR PARENTS ARE DEAD! YOU HAVE NO
                FAMILY! 
 Stop! Stop! 
 Go then. But leave that. 
 And you? 
 Me? 
 Are you staying? Or coming? 
 Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night. Yeah, that’s right.
                Didn’t know I knew, did you? 
 What? Ron, no -- please -
 He’s gone. 
 Salvio Hexia... Protego Totalum... 
 It’s a Muggle station. 
 Hermione. 
 You were right. It’s like you said. Snitches have flesh memories. But
                I didn’t catch my first Snitch with my hand. I almost swallowed it. 
 ‘I open at the close?’ 
 What do you reckon it means? 
 I don’t know. But look, I’ve found something as well... 
 I thought it was a picture of an eye, but now I don’t think it is.
                It isn’t a rune and it’s not in Spellman’s Syllabary either. And it’s been inked in
                -- somebody drew it -- it isn’t part of the book. 
 Luna’s dad was wearing that, at Ron 
 At
                Bill and Fleur’s wedding. 
 What d’you mean -- wearing it? 
 Around his neck. Like an amulet. I didn’t think much of it at the
                time. You know Luna -- she’s always got some mad thing or the other she’s carrying
                around. I just figured it ran in the family. 
 Why would someone have drawn it in a children’s book? 
 Hermione, I’ve been thinking. I -- I want to go to Godric’s Hollow.
                It’s where I was born, it’s where my parents died - 
 And it’s exactly where You-Know- Who will expect you to go. Because
                it means something to you. 
 But it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who nearly died
                there. Wouldn’t that be just the kind of place he’d hide a Horcrux? 
 It’s dangerous, Harry. But I have to admit, recently even I’ve been
                thinking we might have to go. I think it’s possible something else is hidden there.
                    
 The sword. If Dumbledore didn’t want it falling
                into theMinistry’s hands, but wanted you to find it, what better place to hide it
                than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor himself? 
 Godric’s Hollow is the birthplace of Godric Gryffindor -- I mean,
                ’course it is. Obvious, isn’t it? 

                
 Harry, did you ever even open A History of
                Magic? 
 Tossed it at Neville once when he was snoring -- might’ve popped open.
                    
 Hermione... 
 Don’t ever let me give you a haircut again. 
 I still think we should’ve used Polyjuice Potion. 
 No. This is where I was born. I’m not returning as someone else.
                    
 Harry, I think it’s Christmas Eve! Listen... 
 Do you think they’d be in there? My mum and dad? 
 Yeah. I think they would. 
 Harry. 
 Is it -- ? 
 No. But look. 
 Did you know he had a sister? 
 No. 

            
 Lumos. 
 Ignotus... Hey, Har - 

            
 Happy Christmas, Hermione. 
 Happy Christmas, Harry. 
 Harry... 
 Yeah. 
 Someone’s watching us. By the gate. 
 C’mon. 
 I don’t think this is a good idea. 
 We look like ordinary Muggles. 
 Muggles who’ve just been laying flowers on your parents’ grave.
                    
 Relax. This is right. I know it. 
 Omigod. Harry... 
 This is where they died, Hermione.
 You’re Bathilda, aren’t you? 
 Harry, I’m not sure about this. 
 Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. Besides,
                she’s barely knee-high to a house-elf. I think we can overpower her if it turns
                ugly. 
 There’s something odd about her. And what’s that smell? 
 She’s gaga, remember? 
 Here. Let me do that. 
 You have a lovely house, Miss Bagshot. Hermione eyes a PHOTOGRAPH
                of a CURIOUSLY COMPELLING YOUNG GIRL 
, then runs a finger along
                a table. It comes away thick with dust. She frowns, looks up, finds Bathilda
                watching her. 
 Miss Bagshot? Who is this man? 
 His name. Can you tell me his name? 
 This is him, Hermione. The one I saw in Gregorovitch’s wand shop. The
                thief. Miss Bagshot, who is he? 
 She wants us to go upstairs. 
 All right... 
 She wants me to go. Alone. 
 Why? 
 It’s all right. You stay here. 
 Harry... 
 Lumos. 

                
 You are Potter? 

                
 Yes. 

                
 (in Parseltongue) I have something for you... 

                
 Harry! 
 Confringo! 

                
 Harry... Harry, can you hear me...? 

                
 Yes. 

                
 Good. That’s good... 

                
 We got away. 

                
 Yes. 

                
 Are you alright? 

                
 I’m fine. But you’ve been sick. Rest... Rest a bit more...
                    

                
 You’ve outdone yourself this time. Hermione turns, finds Harry
                standing outside the tent, admiring the view. He looks pale, battle-worn. 
 The Forest of Dean. I came here once with my mum and dad, years
                ago. It’s just how I remember it. The trees. The river. It’s like nothing’s changed.
                Not true, of course. Everything’s changed. If I brought my parents here, they
                wouldn’t recognize any of it. Not the trees. Not the river. Not... me. 
 Where are they? 
 Wendell and Monica Wilkens now reside happily in Sydney, Australia.
                They have two dogs, run a small sweet shop, but floss daily. No children. She
                smiles, then it fades. 
 Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old. Harry has no
                words. She inhales, shakes off her tears. 
 You wanted to know who the boy in the photograph was. Well, I know.
                    
 It was in Bathilda’s sitting room. Rita Skeeter had sent it to her.
                Harry, it doesn’t make for very nice reading - 
 Who is he, Hermione? The thief? Did Dumbledore know him? 
 Yes. 
 Well? 
 For a time. 
 Tell me, Hermione. Who is he? 
 Gellert Grindelwald. He’s not very well known in Britain, but there
                was a time, before You-Know-Who... 
 Hermione, I don’t need to have read A History of Magic to know who
                Gellert Grindelwald is. Hermione nods, hands him the book, open to a PHOTOGRAPH of a
                TEENAGED DUMBLEDORE laughing with another BOY
. The
                caption: “For the Greater Good? Dark Days; Dumbledore and Grindelwald.” On the
                opposite page is a PHOTOGRAPH of Grindelwald in later days, clad in black, holding a
                JAGGED WAND -- no longer the carefree lad of youth. 
 When Grindelwald was seventeen, he was expelled from Durmstrang.
                He’d started doing some twisted things at school -- experiments. A few teachers had
                always protected him, but they couldn’t anymore. After he left, he traveled for
                awhile, then ended up in Godric’s Hollow where his great aunt lived, Bathilda
                Bagshot. 
 Get to the hard part, Hermione. 
 She introduced him to Dumbledore. It made sense. Dumbledore’s
                mother had just died, Grindelwald was troubled and they were both brilliant --
                they’d never really had anyone they could talk to ont he same level. They did a lot
                of talking that summer. But they always returned to one particular subject. 
 Wizard rule over Muggles. 
 And Dumbledore believed in it? 
 Yes. 
 ‘For the Greater Good.’ What does that mean? 
 It was something Dumbledore came up with. He believed wizards were
                superior and should rule overMuggles, but gently, for their own good. Grindelwald
                took a more violent position. 
 It was a different time, Harry. It was one summer. Dumbledore was
                young - 
 We’re young, Hermione. And here we are, risking our lives to fight
                against the very thing Dumbledore supported. 
 He changed, Harry. Years later, it was Dumbledore who put
                Grindelwald in prison. 
 Where’s my wand? I’ll take the watch. 
 Hermione. Where’s my wand? 
 It’s my fault. As we were leaving Godric’s Hollow, I cast a curse
                and it rebounded... I’m sorry, Harry, I tried to mend it but wands are different - 
 It’s done. 
 Maybe we can - 
 It’s done. 
 Leave me yours. You get back in the warm. And give me that. 
 He loved you, Harry. I know he loved you. 
 No... 
 Lumos! 
 Accio Sword. 
 Diffindo. 
 Hermione... 
 Are -- you --mental? 
 It was you! 
 Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I'd think. 
 And the doe. That was you as well. 
 No. I reckoned it was you. 
 My Patronus is a stag. 
 Right. Antlers. 
 You didn’t see anyone else? 
 No, I... I did think maybe I saw something -- when I was running -- over
                there --
 Anything? 

                
 But I reckon whoever cast the doe, put the sword in
                that pool hoping we’d find it. 
 And we did, didn’t we? 
 See that? It knows. It’s afraid. 
 Do it. 
 What? No. Harry. That thing’s bad for me. I can’t handle it. I’m not
                making excuses for how I acted, but that thing affects me more than it affects you
                and Hermione. It made me think stuff -- stuff I was thinking anyway, but it made
                everything worse. 
 All the more reason. 
 No. I can’t -- 
 Then why are you here? Why did you come back? 
 I’ll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don’t
                hesitate. I don’t know what’s in here, but it’ll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle
                that was in his diary tried to kill me. 
 On three. One. Two. Three. 
 Take me
                inside... 
 Stab it, Ron. Now. 

                
 I have seen your heart and it is mine... 
 Don’t listen to it. 

                
 I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley, and I have seen your
                fears... 
 Ron. Don’t listen to it! 

                
 Least loved, by the mother who craved a daughter. Least loved,
                by the girl who prefers your friend... 
 Ron. Stab it! 
 We were better without you, happier without you. 
 Who could look at you beside Harry Potter? What are you,
                compared with the Chosen One...? 
 Ron. It lies! Stab it! STAB IT! 
 Your mother confessed that she would have preferred me as a
                son... 
 Who wouldn’t prefer him, what woman would take you, you are
                nothing, nothing, nothing to him... 
 Do it, Ron! Kill it! 

            
 After you left, she cried for a week. She’s like my sister. 
 I’m sorry. I’m sorry I left. 
 You’ve sort of made up for it tonight. Getting the sword. Finishing
                off the Horcrux. 
 Saving your life. 
 That too. 
 And just think of it. Only three to go. 

                
 Hermione! 
 Everything all right? 
 Fine. Actually... more than fine. 
 Hey. 
 Wo -- hey -- ouch! 

                
 You -- complete --arse -- Ronald -- Weasley! You
                crawl back here after all these weeks and say, ‘Hey?’ (turning to Harry) Where’s my
                wand? Harry, where’s my wand! 
 Um... I don’t know? 
 Harry Potter, you give me my wand! 
 How come he’s got your wand? 
 Never mind why he’s got my wand -
 What is
                that? 
 You destroyed it? 
 And exactly how is it you have theSword of Gryffindor? 
 It’s a long story. 
 Don’t think this changes anything. 
 No, of course not. I only destroyed a bloody freaking Horcrux! Why would
                that change anything! Do you know what it was like for me to hear those words coming
                from you! To see you doing those things -
 See me doing what things? 
 What happened out there? 

                
 It’s a long story. 
 Look, I wanted to come back the minute I’d left. I just... didn’t know
                how to find you. 
 Exactly how did you find us? 
 With this. 
 It doesn’t just turn off lights. I don’t know exactly how it works, but
                Christmas morning I -- I was sleeping -- in this little pub-- I’d given some
                Snatchers the slip the night before, me being a blood- traitor and all -- anyway, I
                was sleeping when I heard it... 
 It? 
 A voice. 
 Your voice, Hermione. Coming out of this. 
 And what may I ask did I say? 
 My name. Just my name. Like a whisper. 
 So I took this and I clicked it and this tiny ball of light appeared.
                And I knew. 
 Knew what? 
 Just knew. On account of Hermione’s voice. And sure enough, it floated
                toward me, the ball of light, right to my chest and then -- went straight through--
                right here. 
 I could feel it inside me. It was warm, like the first sip of a good cup
                of tea. And I knew it would take me where I needed to go. So I Disapparated and came
                out on this hillside. It was dark. I didn’t have any idea where I was. I just had to
                hope one of you would show yourselves in the end. And you did. 
 I’ve always liked it. These flames Hermione makes. 
 How long you reckon she’ll stay mad at me? 
 Keep talking ‘bout that little ball of light touching your heart --
                she’ll come round. 
 It was true. Every word. 
 You’re going to think I’m
                mental, but I think that’s why Dumbledore left it to me -- the Deluminator. I think
                he knew that at some point I’d... need to find my way back. And she’d lead me.
                    
 Bloody hell. I just realized.
 Yeah... 
 Well, I’ve got one. Here. It’s Blackthorn, ten inches, nothing special,
                but I reckon it’ll do. I took it off a Snatcher a few weeks back.
                    
 Don’t tell Hermione, but they’re a bit dim, Snatchers.
                This one was definitely part Troll. The smell off him... 
 Engorgio. 
 Wo. 
 Reducio! 
 What’s going on in there? 
 Nothing. 

                
 Maybe a bit more practice, eh? 
 We need to talk. 
 All right. 

                
 I want to go and see Xenophilius Lovegood. 
 Sorry? 
 See this? It’s a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at
                the signature. It’s the mark again. 
 It keeps cropping up. Here. In Beedle the Bard. In the graveyard in
                Godric’s Hollow -- what? 
 Jesus. It was there too. 
 Where? 
 Outside Gregorovitch’s wand shop. on the alley wall... 
 But what does it mean? 
 Harry, you don’t have a clue where the next Horcrux is. And neither
                do I. But this, this means something. I’m sure of it. 
 I think Hermione’s right. I think we ought to go and see Lovegood. What
                say we vote on it? Those in favor... 
 Sorry, Harry. Looks like it’s Hermione and me this time. 
 Not still mad at him, are you? 
 I’m always mad at him. 
 Luna? 
 Luna. 
 Keep off the dirigible plums. 

                
 What is it? (to Ron) Who are you? (to Harry) What do you
                want --
 Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I’m Harry Potter. We met a few months back?
                    
 Would it be okay if we came in? It won’t take long, sir. I promise.
            
 Excuse me. 
 So. What brings you here, Mr. Potter? 
 Well, sir, we need some help. 
 Ah. Help. I see. Yes, well, the thing is, helping Harry
                Potter, rather dangerous these days... 
 Aren’t you the one who keeps telling everyone it’s their first duty to
                help Harry? 
 I have expressed that view, yes. In the past. Would you
                excuse me one moment. I shall return shortly and, um, try to help you... 
 What’s going on here? 
 He’s mental. Let’s face it. Luna’s always good value, but she’s nutty as
                squirrel poo. 
 Do you see that? 
 Well, yeah, of course. It’s massive, isn’t it? 
 No! Don’t go near it! 
 It’s an Erumpent horn. It’s a Class B Tradeable Material. 
 Yeah, all right... 
 May I offer you all an infusion of Gurdyroots? We make
                it ourselves. 
 Where is Luna, sir? 
 Luna? Oh, um, she’ll be along. Now how can I help you,
                Mr. Potter? 
 Well, sir, it’s about something you were wearing around your neck at
                the wedding. A symbol... 
 You mean this? 
 Yes! Exactly. What we wondered, sir, is, well, what is it? 
 What is it? Well, it’s the sign of the Deathly Hallows,
                of course. 
 The what? 
 The Deathly Hallows. I assume you’re all familiar with
                ‘The Tale of the Three Brothers?’ 
 Yes. No. 
 It’s in here. 
 Well, there’s no real reason to go on unless one is
                familiar with the tale. Why don’t you read it aloud, Miss...? 
 Granger. Well... all right. 
 There
                were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight
                - 
 Midnight. Mum always said midnight. 

                But twilight’s fine. Better actually. 
 In time, the brothers reached a river too treacherous to pass...
                    

            

                
 But being learned in the magical arts, the three brothers simply
                waved their wands and made a bridge. They were halfway across it when they found
                their path blocked by a hooded figure. 

                
 It was Death and he felt cheated, for travelers usually drowned
                in the river. But Death was cunning. He granted each brother a wish for their
                cleverness. The oldest, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than
                any in existence. So Death fashioned one from an elder tree on the banks of the
                river. 

                
 The second brother, who was an arrogant man, asked for the power
                to recall others from Death. So Death plucked a stone from the river. Finally Death
                turned to the third brother. A humble man, he asked for something that would make
                him disappear. And so it was that Death handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility.
                Death then stepped aside and the brothers went their separate ways... 

                
 The first brother traveled to a distant village where, with
                ElderWand in hand, he killed a wizard with whom he had once quarreled. Proceeding to
                an Inn, he bragged of his invincibility. But that very night... 

                
 ... another wizard crept upon him as he lay sleeping. He took
                the Elder Wand... and slit the brother’s throat for good measure. And so Death took
                the first brother for his own... We see the second brother approach a cottage. 

                
 Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his home, where he
                took out the stone and turned it thrice in hand. To his delight, the girl he had
                once hoped to marry before her untimely death appeared before him. Yet soon she
                turned sad and cold, for she did not belong in the mortal world. Driven mad with
                hopeless longing, the second brother killed himself so as to join her. And so Death
                took the second brother... 

                
 As for the third brother, Death searched for many years but was
                never able to find him. Only when he had attained a great age did the youngest
                brother shed theCloak of Invisibility and give it to his son. He then greeted Death
                as an old friend and went with him gladly, departing this life as equals... 
 Well, there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows. 
 Sorry... I still don’t really understand... 
 The Elder Wand... 
 The Resurrection Stone... 
 The Cloak of Invisibility. Together... they make the
                Deathly Hallows. Together... they make one master of Death. 
 Mr. Lovegood, does the Peverell family have anything to do with the
                Deathly Hallows? 
 That was the name on the grave with
                the mark on it in Godric’s Hollow. Ignotus Peverell. 
 Ignotus and his brothers Cadmus and Antioch are thought
                to be the original owners of the Hallows and therefore the inspiration for the
                story. 
 Ah, but your tea’s grown cold. Excuse me, I'll be right
                back. 

                
 Let’s get out of here once he’s back. I’m not
                touching this stuff, hot or cold. 

                
 Which one would you choose if you could? Of the
                Deathly Hallows? 
 It’s obvious, isn’t it? 
 The
                Wand. 
 The Cloak. The Stone. 
 They glance at each other, amused. 
 You’re supposed to say the Cloak, but who wants to spend all day being
                invisible. Dead boring if you ask me. But an unbeatable wand! 
 Its owner grew drunk with power and was murdered. 
 Yeah, but imagine what a short wicked life you’d lead. 

                
 Why the Stone, Harry? 
 Well, you could bring people back, couldn’t you? Mad-Eye. Dumbledore.
                Sirius. Anybody. 

                
 But according to the story they don’t want to come back. It’s
                all rubbish anyway. There’s no such thing as the Deathly Hallows. 
 But I have one. The InvisibilityCloak my father left me. 
 There have always been Cloaks -- 
 Not like Harry’s. I’ve seen a fair few. Dad used to bring home the ones
                the Ministry confiscated from petty thieves and the like. They always got holes or
                tears. Harry’s is different. It’s perfect. 
 And I think I’ve actually held theResurrection Stone in my hands, that
                night in Dumbledore’s office when he showed me the ring he’d destroyed, the Horcrux.
                It had a symbol on it. Now I think it was the mark of the Hallows. 
 Mr. Lovegood. Thank you, sir -- 
 You forgot the water. 
 The water? 
 For the tea. 
 Did, didn’t I? How silly of me. 
 No matter, sir. We really ought to be go- 
 No, you mustn’t - 
 Sir? 
 You’re my only hope. They were angry, you see, about
                what I’d been writing, so they took her. They took my Luna... 
 But it’s really you they want... 
 Who took her, sir? 
 Him. Surely you call him You-Know-Who. But his real name
                of course is... Voldemort. 
 Nooooooooo! 
 Stop! I’ve got him --
 Ron! Harry! Take my hand! 
 That treacherous old bleeder! Is there no one we can trust! 

                
 They’ve kidnapped Luna because he supported me. He was just
                desperate. 
 I’ll do the enchantments. 
 A wand BLOOMS above, illuminates the face of Scabior. Hermione’s
                red scarf, now faded and filthy, dangles from his neck. He presses it to his grimy
                nose, inhales andGRINS. 
 Hello, beautiful. 
 Ah, Tom, I thought you would come one day. But surely you must
                knowI no longer have what you seek... 
 If not you, then who? 
 You’re so innocent, Tom. Like a schoolboy. There’s so much you
                don’t understand... 
 Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where to find it! Tell me who
                possesses it! The name, Grindelwald! The name! 
 Can’t you guess, Tom? It lies with him, of course. Buried within
                the earth. It is he who possesses it, even in death. Your old friend and
                mine...Dumbledore. 
 They exist. The Hallows. 
 But he only wants the one, the last one. That’s what he’s been looking
                for. 
 What’re you saying? 
 He knows where it is, You-Know- Who. He’ll have it by the end of the
                night. He’s found the Elder Wand. 
 Don’t touch her! 
 Stop it! 
 Your boyfriend’ll get worse than that if he doesn’t behave, lovely.
                    
 What happened to you, ugly? 
 What’s your name? 
 Dudley. Vernon Dudley. 
 Check the list. And you, ginger? 
 Stan Shunpike. 
 Like ‘ell you are. We know skinnyStan. Try again. 
 Weasley... 
 Barney Weasley. 
 Weasley, eh? Wouldn’t be related to that blood traitor Arthur
                Weasley, would you? 
 Piss off! Arthur Weasley’s ten times the wizard you are! 
 Worth ten times you if I can find him. Wasn’t you that tipped him
                off, was it? 
 How ‘bout you, lovely? What do they call you...? 
 Penelope Clearwater. Half-blood. 
 You smell like vanilla, Penelope. I think you’re going to be my
                favorite. 
 There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere. 
 Hear that, ugly? The list says you’re lying. How come you
                don’t want us to know who you are? Hm? 
 The list is wrong. I told you who I am --
 Change of plans, boys. We won’t be taking this lot to the Ministry.
            
 What did you put on me? 
 A Stinging Jinx. 
 How long will it last? 
 Not long. 
 Show me.
