      <description>The scene opens up in a forest. Katara and Aang are on a raised, grassy
                plateau. A gentle stream is running out beneath it. Katara is folding one of their
                sleeping blankets. Aang is lying on the root of a tree. Momo screeches and lands on
                the plateau as Sokka approaches.</description>

         <charAction>Digs nuts from his bag.</charAction> We've got a few options. First;
            round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might

      <description>Momo coos, and sniffs the rock-shaped nut, before taking it with one of his
                paws and slapping it against a stone twice. Attempting to break it, he takes it with
                both paws and slams it down on the big rock. The moment he does so, however, the
                entire earth quakes, making Momo shriek and his hair stand up on end.</description>

      <description>Momo, believing he may have caused the quake, cautiously drops the rock to

      <description>The three, joined by Momo, hide behind a fallen tree and spy on a young boy
                bending boulders into the air and punching them into the side of the

      <description>The young boy gasps in surprise, dropping the boulder he was bending to the

   <section>
      <description>Haru's mother opens the door, allowing the Fire Nation tax collector to
                walk inside. He stares awkwardly at the four children in front of him. Haru grasps
                his chin and stares toward Katara, cross-eyed. Sokka eyeballs an apple. Katara
                hunches forward with her eyes wide open, having stuffed her mouth with berries. Aang
                has his hand atop a barrel, beaming an immense toothy smile. His pose is short-lived
                as the barrel's lid spins, dunking Aang's hand into the barrel of water and causes
                him to fall down.</description>

      <description>Haru's mother and the tax collector approach the store's counter, where she
                opens a small chest and passes a meager handful of Earth Kingdom currency to the tax
                collector. Haru leans against the counter, staring with contempt toward the Fire

      <description>Fire Nation troops march on a mission through the dead of night. The man in
                the lead raps on a wooden door. Haru answers the door, suddenly gasping in shock as

      <description>The Fire Nation leader shoves the old man out of the way and approaches

                away.</description>
      <description>In the morning, Katara carries a jar outside of the barn. She sets it down
                beside a water pump and proceeds to waterbend, drawing water out of the spigot and
                into the waiting pot. Picking it up, she spots Haru's mother standing with her back
                to her, gazing toward the distant ocean. Haru's mother slowly turns around, laying a
                tearful gaze upon Katara. Katara realizes Haru has been taken and drops the pot, as
                it shatters to pieces at her feet.</description>

      <description>At Katara's shout, Aang gasps quietly as he realizes his mistake by missing

                a strong jet of air into the ventilation duct, suddenly sending the boulder
                levitating into the air. This reveals Momo behind the boulder, who has his arms

      <description>Katara is in the back of a Fire Nation transport with other earthbender
                prisoners. She wears a brown, tattered prison garb over her blue Water Tribe outfit
                and stares glumly downward. Sokka and Aang each have conical yellow hats in a crowd,
                attempting to stealthily observe her travel. Katara looks longingly over shoulder as
                the cart bobs along a pier, heading toward a waiting barge on the
                ocean.</description>
      <description>Aang and Sokka chase the barge, riding Appa through the clouds. The

      <description>After the barge arrives, six prisoners, including Katara, line up on the

      <description>The warden pauses, suddenly interrupted by a prisoner in line coughing.
                With no forewarning, the warden leaps into the air and aims a blast of fire at the
                prisoner's legs in anger. The prisoner cowers away for safety as the warden stands

            earthbenders who guard its borders. <charAction>The watchman walks up to talk the
                warden, but the warden stops him and listens.</charAction> Some of you may think
            that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to
            bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your
            courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced
            to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that
            make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has
            eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So

      <description>Katara's speech is met with utter silence and a small cough in the
                background, leaving her to fall into sorrow as she realizes the muted answer she
                receives. The warden walks away from the courtyard. Later that night while she is
                sleeping, Aang sneaks into the prison and taps his hand to her shoulder, waking her.
                Urging her to be quiet, he leads her to the perimeter where Sokka and Appa are

      <description>Morning arrives, the scene gaining light. Sokka and Katara are alone by an
                air duct. Sokka is peering down into it, while Katara kneels beside it with her
                hands on its rim.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're
            gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. <charAction>The camera zooms
                through a visual walkthrough of Sokka's explanation.</charAction> There's a huge
            deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed
            off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to
            go, right back here.</speech>

      <description>The two siblings are suddenly surrounded by a number of spear-wielding Fire
                Nation guards. The prisoners have gathered a safe distance away from this spectacle,
                observing what is happening.</description>

      <description>A sudden rush of air fills their ears as the facility shakes. The
                ventilation shaft bursts off its hinges as an immense blast of coal soars into the
                air, crashing down into a gathered pile. Everyone present is silent, staring in
                stark surprise at this turn of events. Lastly, Aang leaps out from the barren
                ventilation shaft, landing atop the coal pile and coughing, covered in soot and
                dirt. Momo follows him and Katara runs up to the coal, turning to face the
                earthbenders.</description>

      <description>Haru bolts ahead without hesitation, prepared to bend the waiting coal as a

            thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people? Look at these
            blank, hopeless faces. Their spirits were broken a long time ago. <charAction>Katara's
                expression dims as she does as instructed, staring at the forlorn
                prisoners.</charAction> Oh, but you still believe in them. How sweet. They're a
            waste of your energy little girl. You failed.&gt;

      <description>The warden finishes his speech by turning to take leave of the facility. As
                he does so, a single piece of coal sails through the air and pelts the back of his
                head. Outraged, the warden spins back to see who dared to attack him. Haru stands
                defiantly levitating three pieces of coal above his hand. The warden sends a blast
                of fire toward Haru, but the fire is blocked, as Tyro raises a wall of coal in his
                defense.</description>

      <description>Slamming the coal to the ground; chunks of rock assault the guards. The
                battle immediately flares, prisoners ducking blasts of fire and countering with
                fists of coal. Katara and Aang chase after Sokka as he snaps soldiers spears in two
                with his boomerang, tossing the broken shafts to Momo overhead. Momo continues to
                collect other pieces of broken spears that are thrown up to him.</description>
      <description>Tyro and Haru work in unison to compress gathered coal into one lump,
                slinging this through the doors to make way for their escape. The guards on top fall
                down.</description>

      <description>Katara and Sokka drop heaps of coal into his funnel, firing the material
                rapidly at the warden and his fellow benders, knocking them to the ground. Following
                this, Tyro and two other earthbenders work together to lift coal beneath these
                adversaries, moving them away from the rig and over the ocean.</description>

      <description>Back on the prison rig, Zuko stands alone facing the sunset amid coal lying
