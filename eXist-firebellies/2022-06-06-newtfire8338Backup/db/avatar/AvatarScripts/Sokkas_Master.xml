                it, sighing in relaxation. The camera quickly zooms out to a shot of Sokka lying on
                the easy chair he made from rocks and moss, expressing his content. Cut to a shot of

                    sitting in the foreground. Sokka and Fat thrust and parry a few strikes. Sokka
                    swings his sword in a circle and tries to hit Fat's leg, but Fat pulls his leg
                    up and he avoids the attack. Cut to a close-up of the two from behind Sokka. The
                    scene goes into slow motion as Fat swings his sword and Sokka parries it. Sokka
                    returns the strike and is also parried. The camera cuts to behind Fat as Sokka
                    continues his offense with four quick thrusts. Fat blocks all the attacks and
                    tries to attack Sokka. He misses, and Sokka uses this opportunity to slip the
                    blade of his wooden sword under Fat's hand and fling the wooden sword from it.
                    Fat is shocked and raises his hands in defeat as Sokka thrusts his sword forward
                    and places the blade on the side of Fat's neck, ending the duel. Sokka steps
                    away from Fat, puts his hands together and bows to Piandao, while Fat frowns
                    angrily at him. It cuts to a shot of Piandao sipping a drink from a cup with a

      <description>Cut to a shot of Sokka running out of the bamboo and back toward the sword
                fighting ring, screaming in terror and Piandao not far behind. The camera shifts to

                off to the side and out of sight. Side-view of Sokka who turns to look ahead only
                for Piandao to strike out in front of him, trying to make him run into it. However,

                close-up of Sokka sliding under the blade. The scene comes back to normal speed and

                sword into the ground to stop his fall. Cut behind Sokka as he uses his momentum to
                swing his sword back around, flinging dirt and dust at Piandao. The scene goes into
                slow motion again and the camera cuts to a close-up of Piandao as the dirt hits him
                in the face, blinding him. The scene comes back to normal speed and cuts to a
                frontal shot of Piandao as he spins around and positions his sword behind his back

                and zooms out as he nervously raises his sword defensively. He slowly tries to sneak

                hands. Side-view of the fight as Sokka watches his sword fly into the air and stab
                into the ground several feet away.</description>

                    swings his sword in large, horizontal arc at Sokka. Sokka is not cut by the
                    blade, but is instead hit in the chest by Piandao's arms, knocking him on his
                    back. Cut to Sokka landing on the ground and he looks up fearfully. Cut to
                    frontal view of Piandao from the ground as Piandao turns and points his sword at
