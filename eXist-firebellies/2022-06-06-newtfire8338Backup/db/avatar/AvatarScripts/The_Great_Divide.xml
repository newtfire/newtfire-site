      <description>Opening shot of the sun setting behind some tall rock outcroppings. The sky
                is mostly cloudy and the clouds reflect the light of the dying sun. Pan down to show
                a patched up tent being jostled about from the inside. A rolled up tarp lies next to
                the tent. Sokka is inside a tent, trying to assemble it. Sokka can be heard grunting
                and fussing about as he tries to finish setting up the shelter. Katara walks in the
                frame, her back to the camera, with a pile of fire wood in her arms.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Right, got it ... <charAction>Tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the
                tent.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top&gt; of the
            tent. You know, so we don't get rained on? <charAction>Cut to an overhead shot of the
                two, Sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides
            that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">But what if it does rain?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Spreading his arms wide in exasperation.</charAction> What if it
            doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You're infuriating!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is
            looking pretty sorry.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> Well, if you don't like my firewood-
                <charAction>Throws the sticks at Sokka who shields himself from the wood. He stands
                in anger after the hail of sticks subsides.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job-
                <charAction>He tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as Aang
                approaches.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Okay, I got the grub if you guys got the- <charAction>The siblings turn away from
                each other in anger with their arms folded.</charAction> hey, where's the campfire?
            And what happened to the tent?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the <charAction>Picks up and throws a
                twig at Sokka's head.</charAction> Tents! <charAction>Sokka turns around, looking
                angrily at her.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Laughs.</charAction> Okay, listen guys, harsh words won't solve
            problems, action will. Why don't you just switch jobs?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Sounds good.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Grinning while gloating.</charAction> You see that? Settling feuds and
            making peace, all in a day's work for the Avatar. <charAction>Turns his head to see Momo
                and Appa fighting over a watermelon. Momo continuously tries to fly away with it,
                while Appa pins it down. Aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it. Momo
                seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and Appa got the
                bigger half.</charAction> Come on, Momo, that's fair. Appa's got five stomachs.
                <charAction>Appa eats his half of the melon.</charAction>

         <charAction>In awe.</charAction> Wow, I could just stare at it forever.
                <charAction>Zoom backward to show Sokka in the foreground.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Okay, I've seen enough.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire
            world.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">Believe me, he's more than a tour guide, he's an earthbender, <charAction>Oblivious
                to the fact that Sokka is behind him, mocking him.</charAction> and the only way in
            and out of the canyon is with his help, and he's taking my
            tribe across next.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Calm down, we know you're next.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">You wouldn't be so calm if the Fire Nation destroyed your home and forced you&gt; to
            flee! My whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of Ba Sing
            Se.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">Huh, tell me something I don't know.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A large group of poorly dressed people is shown walking toward
                them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Is that your tribe?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">It most certainly is not! That's the Zhang tribe, a bunch of low-life thieves.
            They've been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years. <charAction>Whistles to
                them.</charAction> Hey, Zhangs! I'm saving a spot for my tribe so don't even think
            about stealing it!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhang leader">Where are the rest of the Gan Jin? Still tidying up their camp site?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">Yes, but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhang leader">I didn't know the canyon guide took reservations.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">Ha, of course you didn't! That's the ignorance I'd expect from a messy
                Zhang.&gt; So unorganized and ill-prepared for a journey. <charAction>The
                Zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them. Katara and Aang look at each
                other worriedly, but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and
                thrown away. The canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to
            be.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">Sorry about the wait, youngsters. Who's ready to cross this here canyon?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Uh, one of them, I think. <charAction>Camera pans left to reveal the Zhang and the
                scout.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">
         <charAction>Rushing forward.</charAction> I was here first, my party's on their
            way.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">I can't guide people who aren't here. <charAction>Cut to a wider shot showing the
                Zhang filing past the three kids and the fuming Gan Jin scout.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhang leader">
         <charAction>Mockingly.</charAction> Guess you guys will have to make the trip
            tomorrow.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot shifts to a close-up the scout, whose eyes twitch in anger. The
                camera zooms backward and pans left to reveal another tribe entering the canyon
                entrance area. The scout points to them in triumph.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin tribesman">Wait, here they come! <charAction>A group of clean, finely dressed people are shown
                coming toward them.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhang leader">
         <charAction>To the canyon guide.</charAction> You're not seriously gonna cave into
            these spoiled Gan Jins? I mean we're refugees too! And we've got sick people that need
            shelter.</speech>

            slobs.</speech>

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I don't know, a fight over chores is one thing, but these people have been feuding
            for a hundred years.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Stepping forward.</charAction> Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar,
            and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make
            everyone happy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Uh, you could share the earthbender and travel
            together?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin leader">Absolutely not! We'd rather be taken by the Fire Nation than travel with those
            stinking thieves!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhang leader">We wouldn't travel with those pompous fools anyway! <charAction>The two tribes begin

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Shouting.</charAction> All right here's the deal, you're all going down
            together and Appa here will fly your sick and elderly across! Does that seem fair?
                <charAction>Both leaders nod in agreement, and the scene fades to show the sick and
                elderly boarding Appa.</charAction>

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea
            getting involved in this?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Grinning broadly.</charAction> To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. But
            when have I ever been?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Dismayed.</charAction> His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon
            on foot isn't it? <charAction>Cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the
                others.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">Okay, now comes the bad news. <charAction>Cut to a frontal shot of the
                guide.</charAction> No food allowed in the canyon, it attracts <charAction>He makes
                motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the
                canyon.</charAction>
            dangerous predators. <charAction>Both tribes yell out in
                protest.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gan Jin Leader">No food?! This is ridiculous.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">Oh, you babies can go a day without food? Would you rather be hungry, or dead?
                <charAction>He raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest. He continues, cupping
                his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice.</charAction> Now, we're heading down in
            ten minutes. All food better be in your gut or in the garbage!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The Zhang tribe quickly whips out and shoves food into their mouths, which
                stands in stark contrast to the Gan Jin tribe, who eat slowly with
                chopsticks.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>To the people on Appa.</charAction> Appa's going to take good care of
            you 'till we get there. <charAction>To Appa.</charAction> See you on the other side,
            buddy! Yip yip! <charAction>Appa roars and takes off. The camera fades to show both
                groups of people climbing down into the canyon. The tour guide earthbends to form a
                bridge in a gap in the path.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Nice bending!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">The job's much more than bending, kid. Folks want information. <charAction>Turns to
                the travelers.</charAction> Many of you are probably wondering how canyons are
            formed. Experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth
            spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper
            sacrifice.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara and Sokka look up in fear as an avalanche of rocks comes falling
                toward them, and the canyon guide earthbends it away from them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">He he he, guess the spirits are still angry! Hope you all brought
            sacrifices.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a wide shot of the canyon floor and the canyon wall on the right
                side of the screen. The view pans slowly rightward before cutting to a closer,
                overhead shot of the group now at the bottom of the switchback trail. They have just
                entered the canyon floor. The guide stands in front of the two tribes and the kids.
                Katara, Aang, and Sokka look at each other in exasperation and the scene fades to
                show them standing at the bottom of the canyon next to a huge boulder.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">Okay, everyone stand clear of the wall. <charAction>He throws the boulder and
                destroys the bridge he had made earlier.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Canyon guide">These people are fleeing the Fire Nation, aren't they? Gotta make sure we can't be
            followed. We'll be safe now. <charAction>Yells out, as he is picked up by a huge animal.
                Aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We gotta help him! <charAction>He throws his boomerang at the crawler, which drops
                the canyon guide and comes after Sokka instead.</charAction> Okay, now we gotta help
                me! <charAction>Katara comes to his aid and does a water
                whip on the crawler, but she is quickly thrown aside. Aang jumps down and sends a
                multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away.</charAction>

            warrior who was assigned an important duty, transporting our sacred orb from the great
            eastern gate, to the great western gate. Taking the orb from the east to the west
            represents the sun's rising and setting. It was our tribe's ancient redemption ritual.
            But as he approached the gate, Jin Wei was attacked by one of the Zhang, a vermin named
            Wei Jin, who looked at the orb with envy. That coward Wei Jin knocked Jin Wei to the
            ground, and stole our sacred orb. <charAction>Camera goes back to the Gan Jin leader's

            the distance. It was a man of the Gan Jin tribe, Jin Wei, collapsed on the ground. Noble
            Wei Jin stopped to help him. Jin Wei was transporting a sacred orb, a very powerful
            relic used in his tribe's redemption ritual. Wei Jin tried to tend to the man's wounds
            but Jin Wei insisted the orb was more important, and asked him to take it back to his
            tribe. Kind Wei Jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could, but as Wei
            Jin crossed the border to return the orb into Gan Jin territory, he was arrested.
            Instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed, they sentenced him to twenty

                Voice-over.</charAction> There seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened.
            First of all, Jin Wei and Wei Jin weren't enemies. They were brothers, twins in fact,
            and they were eight; and most importantly, they were just playing a game! The sacred orb
            from the legend, that was the ball! And the eastern and western gates were the goal
            posts. Jin Wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it.
            Wei Jin didn't steal the ball, he picked it up and started running it toward the other
            goal, but he stepped out of bounds, so the official put him in the penalty box. Not for
            twenty long years but for two short minutes. <charAction>Fades back to
                Aang.</charAction> There was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison, it was
            just a game.</speech>

            end to the other, everyone would yell "redemption"! <charAction>The tribe leaders look
                at each other skeptically.</charAction> Don't get me wrong, Wei Jin was kind of a
            slob and Jin Wei was a little stuffy, that much is true. But they respected each other's
