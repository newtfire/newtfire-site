      <description>The episode opens to a waxing gibbous moon glowing in the night sky. The
                scene cuts to a shot of a field of fire lilies, a mountain in the distance. Cuts to
                a forested area, where Team Avatar is camping out among the trees. The darkness of
                the night gives the landscape an ominous feeling.</description>

      <description>Cuts to shot of the entire group sitting around the campfire. Aang is lying

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No, it happened to Mom.</speech>

      <description>Upon hearing this, Sokka stiffens. Cuts to Aang, who sits up to listen
                intently.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A
            month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and
            some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home.
                <charAction>Cuts to ground-level shot of the group sitting around the fire, the
                camera panning slightly to the right.</charAction> Just a fire flickering in the
            fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was
            alone, she heard a voice. <charAction>In a scary voice.</charAction> "It's so cold and I
            can't get warm!" <charAction>Sokka stiffens in fear.</charAction> Mom turned and saw
            Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help,
            but when everyone came back, Nini was gone.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang uses Momo's ears to cover his face in fear. The camera shifts to show
                Sokka hiding behind a gnarled tree stump.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Peering from behind a tree trunk.</charAction> Where'd she go?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke
            coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The camera zooms out to where the gang is all huddled by the fire.
                Suddenly, Toph straightens up and places her hands on the ground.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Gasping.</charAction> Wait! Guys, did you hear that? <charAction>Aang,
                Katara, and Sokka clutch each other tightly, too stiff to move, with Toph standing
                alertly.</charAction> I hear people under the mountain. And they're
            screaming.</speech>

      <description>Everyone screams in terror upon hearing the strange woman's voice and

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hama">Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. <charAction>Cuts to side-view of the
                campsite.</charAction> You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at
            night. <charAction>Cuts to ground-level shot of Hama standing over the
                fire.</charAction> I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some
            spiced tea and warm beds?</speech>

         <charAction>Sheepishly, places arm behind head.</charAction> Yes, please.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Hama smiles and begins walking away. The scene changes to a village, her
                local inn lying atop a small hill. Cuts to inside the building, where tea is being
                poured into a teacup. Cuts to shot of the group sitting around the kitchen
                table.</description>

      <speech speaker="Hama">
         <charAction>Sets her teacup down.</charAction> When the moon turns full, people walk

                smiling.</charAction> Who wants more tea?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to shot of the group, who has by now fallen completely silent, the
                camera panning to the right to show all of them sitting around the
                table.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hama">Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. <charAction>Clasps hands together

            night's rest?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to Sokka's room, where he is lying in bed with Momo
                asleep on the floor. Cuts to shot of him in bed as he rolls over. A creaking noise
                comes from outside, frightening him. He draws his sword quickly while Momo scampers
                under the covers.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I know, Momo. <charAction>Places sword back inside holster and sets it
                down.</charAction> This place is creepy! <charAction>Lies back down on the pillow
                and pulls the covers over him.</charAction> I don't know if I'm gonna be able to
            fall asleep!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene switches over to later in the night, where Sokka is fast asleep
                in his bed, snoring and drooling on his pillow. As it fades to the morning, he is
                lying sideways, next to the bed, though still fast asleep. Cut to a close-up of his
                face as a shadow approaches him. He slowly awakens, rubbing his eye.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Katara appears by her side, dressed and happily smiling. The camera shifts
                counter-clockwise, showing Sokka later in the day, dressed in his ordinary clothes,
                standing in the marketplace where Hama has just made her purchase. A friendly old
                man smiles and waves to her as she walks away.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll
            give us some free komodo sausages?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Hama">
         <charAction>Seriously.</charAction> You would have me use my feminine charms to take

            going to get along swimmingly!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>The two walk off-camera with Katara smiling at this remark. The scene

   <section>
      <description>She smiles creepily and saunters away, leaving Sokka feeling suspicious.
                The scene changes to a shot of Hama's inn, starting outside, before moving inside,
                where the gang is unpacking groceries. Sokka walks over to a counter and sets his
                basket down.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Unpacking items.</charAction> That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who

            kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at
            night? Isn't that a little mysterious?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I'm gonna take a look around. <charAction>Walks away and up a flight of wooden

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The cupboard suddenly opens, revealing several wooden puppets stowed
                inside. The dolls fall forward, held together only by their strings. Everyone gasps;
                Sokka withdraws his sword, backs up and points it straight at the
                puppets.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">We'll see. <charAction>Peers through the keyhole into the room. Cuts to shot of the

                chest lying on the ground in the middle. The camera zooms in on the
                chest.</charAction> It's empty, except for a little chest.</speech>

      <description>Katara turns to leave the moment Toph signals that she has successfully
                opened the chest, holding her thumb up. All four eagerly surround the box in a

                guiltily hands her the box. Cuts to shot from inside the chest, as Hama lifts the
                lid and reaches her hand inside. Cuts to close-up of Sokka, his eyes wide in
                anxiousness, and a shot of Hama still in the process of lifting the object. Cuts to
                shot of the team standing together from her perspective. Her left arm appears
                on-screen, a blue whale tooth comb in her hand. Cuts to shot of her holding the

      <description>The scene changes to later that night, where Aang races from the inn to the
                barn located toward the back of the property. Cuts to overhead shot of inside the
                barn, where Appa and Momo lie. The doors creak open and Aang steps inside. Cuts to
                ground-level shot of him standing before the bison, tossing a cabbage-like vegetable
                into Appa's mouth. Momo dances in front of the bison's face and chitters, irritated.
                Appa opens his mouth and releases the cabbage, which Momo grabs. The lemur skitters
                away. Cuts to shot of Hama's kitchen table, as she sets down a bowl of soup. Cuts to
                shot of the entire room, the team and the innkeeper sitting around the table. Sokka
                is seen chewing on a food item, as Hama takes her seat at the head of the

                their bowls. Cuts to shot of the team looking at the spectacle in astonishment, the

                ashen snow falling from the sky. The two race to the shores, where five Fire Nation
                ships are rapidly approaching the tribe. Five fireballs are launched from trebuchets
                and strike the village. Fire Nation soldiers swarm the area, battling the
                waterbenders, who desperately attempt to fend them off.</description>

      <description>As she is narrating, Water Tribe civilians who aided in the suspension of
                the vessel are seen slowly fading, signaling their capture by the Fire Nation. The

      <speech speaker="Hama">Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow

      <description>In a quick movement of her right arm, Hama uses waterbending to manipulate
                the water vapor in the air, liquefying it and coating her fingertips.</description>

      <speech speaker="Hama">You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. <charAction>The water around her

            realized that where there is life, there is water. <charAction>A younger Hama is shown
                bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her
                cage.</charAction> The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing
            more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would
            lead to my escape. <charAction>A close-up is shown of Hama smiling at her discovery. The
                scene fades back to present day. Ominously.</charAction> Bloodbending.
                <charAction>Cut to a scared Katara.</charAction> Controlling the water in another
            body, <charAction>Cut to ground shot of both Hama and Katara.</charAction> enforcing
            your own will over theirs. <charAction>The scene fades back to a flashback of young Hama
                controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending.</charAction> Once I had mastered the
            rats, I was ready for the men.</speech>

      <description>The camera switches over to show a Fire Nation guard strolling past the
                cages when a sudden feeling comes over him. Using bloodbending, Hama forces the
                guard to grab hold of his keys and unlock her cell, thus marking her
                escape.</description>

      <description>With swift motions of her hands and arms, Hama uses bloodbending to twist
                Katara around and throw her from side to side. She positions Katara directly before
                her and uses a downward motion of her hand to force her into a submissive
                state.</description>

      <description>Hama laughs cruelly and keeps Katara subdued. The shot is showing the full
                moon slowly fades to a close-up of Katara's face as she is crying. Several moments
                pass as the young waterbender begins to break free from Hama's grip. Hama stares in
                shock as Katara inhales deeply and rises, now free from her grasp.</description>

      <description>A waterbending duel ensues between the two. Katara pulls a ring of water
                around her waist and sends the stream of water at Hama, who halts it and sends it
                back to Katara. In a swift spinning motion, Katara sends the stream toward Hama
                again, who draws water from nearby trees, deflects the attack and sends a highly
                pressurized water jet at her. Katara uses her hands to block the attack,
                disintegrating the water into droplets. Upon seeing Katara's bending prowess, Hama
                becomes shocked, allowing for her opponent to use waterbending to knock her to the
                ground.</description>

      <description>She begins bloodbending Aang and Sokka, who yell in fear, and sends them in
                Katara's direction. Katara pushes them out of her way and draws water from the
                ground, sending a stream at Hama, who in turn draws water from a vine and uses a
                water wheel to deflect the attack.</description>

                Katara, an unsure look on her face as she uses bloodbending to subdue the elder.
                Focusing first on Hama, who grunts in discomfort, the camera turns to show the
                imprisoned villagers and Toph approaching the scene before cutting to moments later
                when the elderly waterbender is arrested, handcuffs placed around her
                wrists.</description>

      <description>The camera focuses on Katara, who is clearly distressed and breaks down in
                tears. Hama is shown laughing evilly as she is dragged away by the villagers. The
                camera returns to focus on Katara, who is crying underneath the full moon as Aang,
                arm around her, and Sokka, hand on her back, attempt to comfort her. Fades to
                credits.</description>
