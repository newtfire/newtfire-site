      <description>The team is situated at the waterfall pond. Sokka is surveying a map. Toph
                is sitting with her feet in the water, moving it back and forth. Aang is swimming
                while Katara is located at the top of the lake near the waterfall. Aang goes
                underwater for a moment and bends an ice cube around himself for
                amusement.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Excitedly.</charAction> Waterbending bomb! Yeah! <charAction>Jumps into
                the water.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The splash sends Aang out of the water, breaks his ice prison, and soaks
                Sokka, Toph, and the maps which he tried to protect.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the
            spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Sorry. <charAction>Wrings her hair dry and bends the water off the
            map.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So, did you figure out what route we're going to take?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to
            Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the
            north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">You sure that's the best way to go?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Quietly.</charAction> Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be
            sensitive?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Katara, it's okay. I know I was upset about losing Appa before, but I just want to
            focus on getting to Ba Sing Se and telling the Earth King about the solar
            eclipse.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Surprised.</charAction> Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing
            better.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Suddenly, three refugees arrive.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Than">Hello there, fellow refugees!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So, you guys are headed to Ba Sing Se, too?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Than">Sure are. We're trying to get there before my wife Ying has her baby.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The three refugees look up in shock.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ying">The Serpent's Pass? Only the truly desperate take that deadly route!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Deadly route. <charAction>Punches Sokka in the arm.</charAction> Great pick,
            Sokka!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well, we are desperate.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Than">You should come with us to Full Moon Bay. Ferries take refugees across the lake.
            It's the fastest way to Ba Sing Se.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ying">And it's hidden, so the Fire Nation can't find it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>At Full Moon Bay.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire
            Nation.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Than">We're all looking for a better life, safe behind the walls of Ba Sing Se.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A ferry departs. Zuko and Iroh are on board.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Who would have thought after all these years, I'd return to the scene of my greatest
            military disgrace ... <charAction>Turns away for a second before turning back with a
                floral hat on his head.</charAction> as a tourist!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Look around. We're not tourists, we're refugees. <charAction>Sips food and spits it
                out.</charAction> Ugh! I'm sick of eating rotten food, sleeping in the dirt. I'm
            tired of living like this!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Aren't we all? My name's Jet and these are my Freedom Fighters, Smellerbee and
            Longshot.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Smellerbee">Hey. <charAction>Longshot nods.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Hello.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Here's the deal. I hear the captain's eating like a king while the refugees have to
            feed off his scraps. Doesn't seem fair, does it?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">What sort of king is he eating like?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">The fat, happy kind. <charAction>At this, Iroh's mouth hangs open as he starts to
                drool.</charAction> You want to help us "liberate" some food?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Tosses the bowl of rotten food into the water.</charAction> I'm
            in.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Jet smirks. </description>
      <description>Back at the station.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">I told you already ... no vegetables on the ferry! One cabbage slug could destroy
            the entire ecosystem of Ba Sing Se! Security!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A platypus bear destroys the cabbage cart.</description>

      <speech speaker="Cabbage merchant">Ahhh! My cabbages! <charAction>He is carried away.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Next!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Um, four tickets for the ferry to Ba Sing Se, please.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Passports?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Uh ... no one told us we had to have passports.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Ah, I see fifty Avatars a day and, by the way, not a very impressive costume.
                <charAction>The screen pans to show several impostors; notices Momo.</charAction>
            Besides, no animals allowed. Do I need to call security?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The platypus bear chomps down on the cabbage. Momo hides in
                fear.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">That won't be necessary.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Next!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I'll take care of this. My name is Toph Beifong, and I'll need four tickets.
                <charAction>Presents her passport.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Ah, the golden seal of the flying boar! It is my pleasure to help anyone of the
            Beifong family.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">It is your pleasure. As you can see, I am blind and these three imbeciles are my
            valets. <charAction>Sweeps her arm behind her, presenting her friends to the hesitant
                clerk.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">But, the animal-</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">-is my seeing-eye lemur.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Well, normally it's only one ticket per passport, but this document is so official
            ... I guess it's worth four tickets. <charAction>Stamps an approval seal on the
                tickets.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Thank you very much.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">All right, we scammed that lady good!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Suddenly, a security guard, actually Suki without makeup, grabs
                Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Tickets and passports please.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Is there a problem?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Yeah, I got a problem with you! I've seen your type before. Probably sarcastic,
            think you're hilarious and let me guess, you're traveling with the Avatar.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Do I know you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">You mean you don't remember? Maybe you'll remember this! <charAction>Kisses Sokka on
                the cheek.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Suki! <charAction>Embraces her.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Sokka, it's good to see you!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Later, in a different location of the station. The gang and Suki
                talk.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">That crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them. And look at you,
            sleeveless guy. Been working out?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing
            major.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Are the other Kyoshi Warriors around?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Yeah. After you left Kyoshi, we wanted to find a way to help people. We ended up
            escorting some refugees and we've been here ever since. <charAction>Momo jumps up next
                to her.</charAction> Hi, Momo! Good to see you too! <charAction>Scratches his head
                near his ear.</charAction> So why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry?
            Wouldn't you just fly across on Appa?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">I'm so sorry to hear that. <charAction>To Aang.</charAction> Are you doing
            okay?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I'm doing fine. Would everybody stop worrying about me?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ying">Avatar Aang, you have to help us! Someone took all of our belongings; our passports,
            our tickets, everything's gone!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I'll talk to the lady for you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Back at the desk.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">No passports, no tickets! <charAction>Stamps a "denied" stamp on Aang's
                forehead.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">But she's pregnant and all of her stuff was stolen! You have to make an
            exception!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">No exceptions! If I just gave away tickets willy-nilly to anyone, there would be no
            more order! You know what that means, no more civilization!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What if we gave them our tickets?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">No!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">But ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ticket lady">Next!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Don't worry, you'll get to the city safely. I'll lead you through the Serpent's
            Pass.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Moments later.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's
            Pass.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I can't believe you're still complaining about it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">
         <charAction>In her normal Kyoshi Warrior attire.</charAction> I'm coming
            too!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Are you sure that's a good idea?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Sokka, I thought you'd want me to come.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I do, it's just–</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Just what?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Nothing. I'm glad you're coming.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Outside, at the pass.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know,
            like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ying">Look at this writing! How awful!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What does it say?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">It says, "abandon hope".</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ying">How can we abandon hope? It's all we have!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I don't know. The monks used to say that hope was just a distraction, so maybe we do
            need to abandon it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">What are you talking about?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Hope is not going to get us into Ba Sing Se and it's not going to help find Appa. We
            need to focus on what we're doing right now and that's getting across this
            path.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Okay, if you say so.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Within the pass.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">The Fire Nation controls the western lake. Rumor has it they're working on something
            big on the other side of it and don't want anyone to find out what it is.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They all pass by a sailing Fire Nation ship. A part of the rock gives out,
                causing Than to fall. Toph stops it from falling and lifts him back up with
                earthbending.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Than">I'm okay! <charAction>The rock falls to the water, which the Fire Nation ship
                notices. It fires.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang gets on his glider and deflects the fireball back. Another fireball
                hits the mountain, causing several pieces of rock over Suki to fall. Sokka pushes
                her out of the way. Toph bends out a part of the mountain to keep the rocks from
                falling on Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Pretending to be Sokka.</charAction> "Thanks for saving my life, Toph."
            Hey, no problem, Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Hours later, at sunset, the travelers set up their camp. Sokka approaches
                Suki.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give
            away at any moment! <charAction>Moves her sleeping bag.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Sokka, I'm fine, stop worrying!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself!
            Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Back on the ferry. Zuko, Jet, and Smellerbee sneak up to the food storage
                area. Jet breaks the door open with his twin tiger hook swords, and he and Zuko take
                some food.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Smellerbee">Guard's coming!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Longshot fires an arrow with a rope attached to it, allowing the three to
                slide down it. Longshot pulls it away before the guard notices. Back at the pass,
                Aang is standing at the edge of the rock, looking out at the ocean, blankly. Katara
                approaches him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You know, it's okay to miss Appa. <charAction>Aang remains silent.</charAction>
            What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now
            it's like you don't care about him at all.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">You saw what I did out there. I was so angry about losing Appa that I couldn't
            control myself. I hated feeling like that.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to
            hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring.
                <charAction> Holds out her arms.</charAction> Come on, you need a hug.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Bows before her.</charAction> Thank you for your concern, Katara.
                <charAction>Exits.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara shows visible concern.</description>
      <description>In another part of the Pass, Sokka stands by himself, until Suki
                approaches.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">It's a beautiful moon.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, it really is.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Look, I know you're just trying to help, but I can take care of myself.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I know you can.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">Then why are you acting so overprotective?</speech>
   </section>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">What is that thing?</speech>

   <section>
      <description>The shadow breaks through the water, breaking the divide. Toph quickly uses
                her earthbending to raise the ground they are standing on above the water. The
                shadow is actually a large serpent, which appears from the water with a
                shriek.</description>

      <description>Meanwhile, the serpent is caught in a whirlpool created by Aang and Katara.
                The force of it slams the serpent into the mountain, causing it to fall back below
                water. Upon seeing the two return, the rest of the travelers cheer. Moments later,
                near Ba Sing Se's wall.</description>
