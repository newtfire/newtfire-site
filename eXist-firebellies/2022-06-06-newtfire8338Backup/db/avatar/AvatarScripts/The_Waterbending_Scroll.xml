      <description>Scene opens with the camera zoomed out showing Appa flying in above the
                mountains with a few viewable trees, carrying Aang, Katara, Sokka, and
                Momo.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Aang is pacing around on Appa's saddle, breathing heavily.</charAction>
            Would you sit down? <charAction>Turns around from his perch on Appa's head.</charAction>
            If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Worriedly.</charAction> It's what Avatar Roku said. I'm supposed to
            master all four elements before that comet arrives.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>In a sarcastic, amused tone while facing Aang.</charAction> Well, let's
            see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve
            years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Frightfully.</charAction> I haven't even started waterbending and we're
            still weeks away from the North Pole. What am I gonna do?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Grabs Aang's arm.</charAction> Calm down, it's going to be okay.
                <charAction>Aang sits down in front of her.</charAction> If you want, I can try to
            teach you some of the stuff I know.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Smiling.</charAction> You'd do that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Nods and looks over the side of Appa's saddle.</charAction> We'll need
            to find a good source of water first.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Grinning; sarcastically.</charAction> Maybe we can find a puddle for you
            to splash in.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo standing in front of a large
                waterfall and river.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Frowning beside Aang and Katara's ecstatic faces.</charAction> Nice
            puddle.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa flies down into the river and creates a huge splash that soaks and
                almost knocks Momo of the rock he is standing on, turns over, and floats on his
                back.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Takes off his shirt, smiling.</charAction> Yeah! Don't start without me,
            boy! <charAction>Begins to run toward the water.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Somewhat blankly.</charAction> Remember the reason we're here.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Stops short and looks at Katara.</charAction> Oh right. Time to practice
            waterbending. <charAction>Puts his clothes back on.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Great. So what am I supposed to do?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">You could ... clean the gunk out of Appa's toes. <charAction>Hands Sokka a branch
                with a bushel of leaves at the end.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Frowns and crosses his arms.</charAction> So, while you guys are playing
            in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's
            feet?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Smiles; somewhat cheerfully.</charAction> Mud and bugs!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Okay. <charAction>Takes stick and walks over to Appa who is floating in the
                water.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to Zuko's ship in the ocean. On the deck, Zuko is practicing
                firebending with his  Lieutenant Lee when the boat turns and they are thrown to one
                side on their backs.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Close-up of his face; he glares at the tower.</charAction> Someone's
            changing our course.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to a crew member steering the ship at the top of the
                boat.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Storming in, yelling.</charAction> What is the meaning of this mutiny?
            No one told you to change course! <charAction>Shows Iroh and the rest of the crew
                playing Pai Sho behind them.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Actually, someone did. I assure you, it is a matter of utmost importance, Prince
            Zuko. <charAction>Scratches beard.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Hopefully.</charAction> Is it something to do with the Avatar?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Even more urgent. It seems, I- <charAction>Rubs forehead in stress.</charAction> -I
            have lost my lotus tile. <charAction>Moves a piece of his across the Pai Sho
                board.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Confused.</charAction> Lotus tile?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">For my Pai Sho game. Most people think the lotus tile insignificant, but it is
            essential for the unusual strategy that I employ.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>In disbelief.</charAction> You've changed our course for a stupid lotus
            tile?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">See, you, like most people, underestimate it's value. Just give me ten minutes to
            check the merchants at this port of call. <charAction>Excitedly.</charAction> Hopefully,
            they will have the lotus tile in stock and I can get on with my life. <charAction>Zuko
                breathes fire up at the ceiling in anger and Iroh smiles.</charAction> I'm lucky to
            have such an understanding nephew.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The room fills with smoke of Zuko's outburst, clouding the scene from
                view.</description>
      <description>Cut to a scene of a content Appa floating in the river while Sokka stands
                on his stomach and brushes in between his toes with the branch.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do me next. <charAction>Appa moans
                happily.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Shows Katara and Aang by the shore.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get
            frustrated if you don't get it right away. <charAction>She moves her hands back and
                forth and makes small waves in the water, while Aang looks up, smiling.</charAction>
            Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement
            right.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Stands up.</charAction> Like this? <charAction>Does the hand movements
                Katara is doing, but nothing is happening yet.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Kindly.</charAction> That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm
            sure eventually—</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Hey, I'm bending it already! <charAction>Shows Aang making much bigger waves than
                Katara's on his first try.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Surprised.</charAction> Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It
            took me two months to learn that move.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Shrugs shoulders.</charAction> Well, you had to figure it all on your
            own. I'm lucky enough to have a great teacher.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Smiles.</charAction> Thanks.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So, what's next?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. <charAction>She moves
                her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it
                around.</charAction> It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if-
                <charAction>Shows Aang already controlling a stream of water, moving it around and
                above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river, much to Katara's
                dismay.</charAction> Nice work. <charAction>She frowns.</charAction> Though the
            over-the-head flare was unnecessary.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Sorry. <charAction>Excited.</charAction> Well, don't stop now! Keep 'em
            coming!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Looks up sadly.</charAction> Well I kind of know this one other move,
            but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a
            big, powerful wave. <charAction>She moves her hands up, shaking, and starts to get a big
                mass of water to rise out of the river, but it pops before forming into anything
                substantial.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So, like this? <charAction>He raises his hands and creates a massive wave that
                towers over their heads.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Still working on cleaning up Appa, he looks up and stares at Aang's wave
                crashing toward him in fear.</charAction> Aang?! <charAction>The wave throws Sokka
                off into the water and his head slowly rises out, annoyed.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Smiling.</charAction> Looks like I got the hang of that move! What else
            do you got?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Angry at Aang's quick success.</charAction> That's enough practicing for
            today.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Head still sticking out of the water.</charAction> Yeah, I'll say!
                <charAction>Points to the left.</charAction> You just "practiced" our supplies down
            the river. <charAction>Shows a group of bags floating away.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Looking guilty.</charAction> Uh, sorry. <charAction>Smiles
                worriedly.</charAction> I'm sure we can find somewhere to replace all this
            stuff.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender. <charAction>Sinks back
                underwater.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to Katara, Sokka, and Aang walking through the streets of a city
                market and port. Shows many armed men staring at the trio. Sokka and Katara look
                nervous while Aang looks around in wonder.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Walking back from alleyway with a bag over his shoulders.</charAction>
            We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's
            spend it wisely.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Uh, make that two copper pieces, Sokka. I couldn't say no to this whistle!
                <charAction>Pulls out a white whistle that looks like a bison, takes a huge breath
                and blows into it, but it barely makes a sound.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Pulls out fingers over his ears after expecting a loud
                noise.</charAction> It doesn't even work. <charAction>Aang stops blowing when Momo
                squawks at him.</charAction> See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on. <charAction>Aang hands her the
                two copper coins.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to the other side of the port where a man is talking in front of his
                boat docked in the water.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Oh">
         <charAction>Moving hands and shouting excitedly.</charAction> Earth Nation! Fire
            Nation! Water Nation! So long as bargains are your inclination, you're welcome here!
            Don't be shy, come on by! <charAction>Sokka, Katara, and Aang walk by and he runs up to
                them.</charAction> Oh! You there, I can see from your clothing that you're
            world-traveling types. Perhaps I can interest you in some exotic curios?</speech>

                into the light, an iguana parrot on his shoulder.</charAction> That beast would
