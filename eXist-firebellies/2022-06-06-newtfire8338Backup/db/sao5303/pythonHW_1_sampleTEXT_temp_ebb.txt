I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of this for real or not?

So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't be afraid. The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?

Power sleeps within you...

If you give it form...

It will give you strength.

Choose well.

The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder and ruin. Is this the power you seek?

Yes.

Your path is set.

Now, what will you give up in exchange?

The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible destruction. You give up this power?

Yes.

You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up the power of the warrior. Is this the form you choose?

Yes.

You gained the power to fight.

All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself and others.

There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning strong.

Behind you!

I can't open it...

Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more about yourself.

What's most important to you?

Friendship.

Is friendship such a big deal?

What do you want outta life?

To be strong.

To be strong, huh?

What are you so afraid of?

Being indecisive.

Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening?

You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're afraid of being indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your road won't be easy, but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.

Sounds good.

The day you will open the door is both far off and very near.

The closer you get to the light, the greater your shadow becomes.

But don't be afraid. And don't forget...

---But don't be afraid.

You hold the mightiest weapon of all.

So don't forget...

You are the one who will open the door.

Whoa!

Gimme a break, Kairi.

Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.

No! This huge, black THING swallowed me up! I couldn't breathe! I couldn't--

Ow!

Are you still dreaming?

It wasn't a dream! Or was it? I don't know.

What was that place? So bizarre...

Yeah, sure.

Say, Kairi, what was your hometown like? You know, where you grew up.

I've told you before, I don't remember.

Nothing at all?

Nothing.

You ever want to go back?

Hmm. Well, I'm happy here.

Really...

But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it.

I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I wanna see 'em all!

So what're we waiting for?

Hey!

Aren't you guys forgetting about me? So, I guess I'm the only one working on the raft.

And you're just as lazy as he is!

So you noticed. Okay, we'll finish it together.

I'll race you!

Huh?

What, are you kidding?

Ready? Go!

So, can you gather the rest of the supplies? Sora, are you listening to me?

Yeah, I heard you.

Okay, here's what you need to go find: Two Logs, One Cloth, One Rope. Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask. I'm counting on you!

Hey, what's happening man?

Ah, the breeze feels great!

Aww, I can’t believe I lost!

Hey, Sora! You feelin' lucky today!

Man, I’m really off today.

Aww, man. Now the score’s 0 to 1!

Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it's yours.

Tired? Want to call it a day?

Yeah, let's go home.

Okay. It is getting late. We'll finish up tomorrow.

So, Kairi's home is out there somewhere, right?

Could be. We'll never know by staying here.

But how far could a raft take us?

Who knows? If we have to, we'll think of something else.

So, suppose you get to another world. (giggle) What would you do there?

Well, I haven't really thought about it.

It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this island. If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one? And suppose there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of something much greater. So we could've just as easily ended up somewhere else, right?

I don't know.

Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find out. Just sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So let's go.

You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?

Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably would've never thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.

You're welcome.

Sora.

You wanted one, didn't you?

A paopu fruit...

If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined. They'll remain a part of each other's lives no matter what.

C'mon, I know you want to try it.

What are you talking--

Good morning, Your Majesty.

It's nice to see you this morn--

What!

Wake up, Goofy, wake up! This is serious!!

Hey there, Donald. G'morning.

We've got a problem, Goofy! But don't tell anyone...

Queen Minnie?

Not even the queen.

Daisy?

No, it's top secret!

G'morning, ladies.

What?

Hey, Sora. Our raft still needs a name. Let's see... How about Highwind? What would you call it?

Me? Well...hm... Excalibur!

Hey, how about...

The usual?

Let's do it!

You guys at it again? All right, I'll be the judge. The usual rules apply. Take any route you want... First one to tag that tree and make it back here wins.

If I win, I'm captain! And if you win...

I get to share the paopu with Kairi.

Huh?

Deal? The winner gets to share a paopu with Kairi.

Wha... Wait a minute...

Okay! On my count:

Three! Two! One! Go!

Now the score’s 1 to 1!

Man, lighten up. It’s just a name, after all.

Today we collect provisions for our trip! Let’s see. Sora, you’re looking for... One Seagull Egg, Three Mushrooms, Two Coconuts, Three Fish, and fill this up with Drinking Water. But not from the ocean!

Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask.

Hey, Sora. Have you heard about the legendary power of the paopu fruit? They say if you share it with someone you really care for, it binds you together forever and ever through eternity! It's so romantic. I gotta try it sometime.

I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're still no match for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he whipped us all. Well, I guess Kairi can always count on him.

Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today. You know, to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be something there, ya?

Wh-who’s there?

I’ve come to see the door to this world.

Huh?

This world has been connected.

Wh-What are you talking about?

Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

Well, whoever you are, stop freaking me out like this. Huh?

Wh-Where did you come from?

You do not yet know what lies beyond the door.

So, you’re from another world!

There is so very much to learn. You understand so little.

Oh, yeah? Well, you’ll see. I’m gonna get out and learn what’s out there!

A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

This? I’m making a necklace of thalassa shells. In the old days, sailors always wore thalassa shells. They were supposed to ensure a safe voyage. See this?

It’s a charm to help us find each other if we ever get separated. The three of us will always be together.

Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it’s yours.

Tired? Want to call it a day?

Yeah, let’s go home.

Okay, tomorrow’s the big day. We should rest up!

You know, Riku has changed.

What do you mean?

Well...

You okay?

Sora, let’s take the raft and go—just the two of us!

Huh?

Just kidding.

What’s gotten into you? You’re the one that’s changed, Kairi.

Maybe... You know, I was a little afraid at first, but now I’m ready. No matter where I go or what I see, I know I can always come back here.

Right?

Yeah, of course!

That’s good.

Sora, don’t ever change.

Huh?

I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

Oh, dear! What could this mean?

It means we’ll just have to trust the king.

Gawrsh, I sure hope he’s all right.

Your Highness. Don’t worry. We’ll find the king and this


Thank you, both of you.

Daisy, can you take care of the—

Of course. You be careful, now, both of you.

Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you.

Over here!

Cricket’s the name. Jiminy Cricket, at your service.

We hope for your safe return. Please help the king.

You’re coming, too!

Gawrsh, Jiminy, your world disappeared, too?

It was terrible. We were scattered. And as far as I can see, I’m the only one who made it to this castle.

Goofy?

Oh, right... I gotcha. Ya mean, while we’re in other worlds, we can’t let on where we’re from. We’ve gotta protect the world border.




Right. World order.

I guess we’ll need new duds when we get there.

Hello up there? Donald Duck to launch crew! Anytime you’re ready.

Blast off!!

I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.

A storm?

Oh, no, the raft!

Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?

What’s that?

Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!

Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!

The door has opened...

What?

The door has opened, Sora! Now we can go to the outside world!

What are you talking about? We’ve gotta find Kairi!

Kairi’s coming with us!

Once we step through, we might not be able to come back. We may never see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be our only chance. We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the darkness!

Riku...

Keyblade... Keyblade...

Kairi!

Sora...

Whoa!

Look, a star’s goin’ out!

Come on. Let’s hurry.

Where’s that key...

Hey, ya know, maybe we ought to go find Leon.

Uh, Donald. Ya know, I betcha that...

Aw, what do you know, you big palooka?

What do I know? Hmm...

Come on, Pluto.

What a dream...

This isn’t a dream!

Where am I?

Oh, boy.

Do you know where we are?

Hey...

This is totally weird... I’m in another world!

Hey there, how can I... Aw, it’s only a kid.

I’m not a kid! And the name’s Sora!

Okay, okay, simmer down. So why the long face, Sora? You lost or somethin’?

No! Well, maybe. Where are we?

Huh?

Traverse Town... So, gramps, is this really another world?

Don’t call me gramps! The name’s Cid!

Anyway... Not sure what you’re talkin’ about, but this sure ain’t your island.

Hmm... Guess I’d better start looking for Riku and Kairi.

Well, good luck with whatever it is you’re doing. If you ever run into trouble, you come to me.

It’s those creatures from the island!

Doesn’t look like he’s here.

Keep looking!

Hmph. Where is he?

Leeeooon!

Not here, either.

This could take a while...

Leeeon! Mister Leon?

Where are you?

Still haven’t found ‘em? Keep your chin up. Take another look around town.

They’ll come at you out of nowhere.

Who are you?

And they’ll keep on coming at you, as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.

But why? Why would it choose a kid like you?

What’s that supposed to mean?

Never mind. Now, let’s see that Keyblade.

What? There’s no way you’re getting this!

All right, then have it your way.

Hey, you found it. Nice going, Leon.

Still... It looks like things are worse than we thought. A lot worse.

Where...am I?

Sora! Kairi!

Gawrsh, there’s nobody here. Sure is spooky!

Aw, phooey. I’m not scared.

Excuse me. Did the king send you?

Come on, lazy bum. Wake up.

You okay?

I guess...

Those creatures that attacked you are after the Keyblade. But it’s your heart they really want, because you wield the Keyblade.

I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.

Kairi? Who are you talking about?

I’m the great ninja Yuffie.

Huh?

I think you might’ve overdone it, Squall.

That’s Leon.

The Keyblade...

Yeah, we had to get it away from you to shake off those creatures. It turns out that’s how they were tracking you.

It was the only way to conceal your heart from them. But it won’t work for long.

Still hard to believe that you of all people are the chosen one.

Well, I suppose beggars can’t be choosers.

Why don’t you start making sense! What’s going on here?

Okay, you know there are many other worlds out there besides your castle and this town, right?

Yeah.

But they’re supposed to be a secret.

They’ve been secret because they’ve never been connected. Until now.

When the Heartless came, everything changed.

The Heartless?

The ones who attacked you, you remember?

Those without hearts.

The darkness in people’s hearts—that’s what attracts them.

And there is darkness within every heart.

Hey, have you heard of someone named Ansem?

Ansem?

He was studying the Heartless. He recorded all of his findings in a very detailed report.

Gawrsh, uh, can we see it?

It’s pages are scattered everywhere.

Scattered?

To many worlds.

Oh, then maybe the king went to find ‘em.

Yes, those were my thoughts exactly.

We’ve gotta find him quick!

Wait!

First, we need that
!

That’s right. The Keyblade.

So...this is the key?

Exactly!

The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.

That’s why they’ll keep coming after you no matter what.

Well, I didn’t ask for this.

The Keyblade chooses its master. And it chose you.

So tough luck.

How did all this happen? I remember being in my room...

Wait a minute! What happened to my home? My island? Riku! Kairi!

You know what? I really don’t know.

Hey, cheer up! I’ve heard that the Keyblade can open all sorts of locks. Give it a try the next time you find a treasure chest or door lock!

Sooner or later, the Heartless will find you. You’d best prepare yourself.

Prepare myself?

To fight for your life. Are you ready?

I’m ready!

Yuffie, let’s go join Aerith. She should be there now with the other visitors.

Leon!

Yuffie, go!

Yuffie?

Sora, let’s go!

Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s go!

Gawrsh, are these the Heartless guys?

Let’s go get ‘em, Goofy!

The key!

So, you were looking for me?

Uh-huh!

They, too, have been seeking the wielder of the Keyblade.

Hey, why don’t you come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel.

I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi...

Of course.

Are you sure?

Who knows? But we need him to come with us to help us find the king.

Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.

Yeah, I guess.

But you can’t come along looking like that. Understand?

No frowning. No sad face. Okay?

Yeah, ya gotta look funny, like us!

This boat runs on happy faces.

Happy?

That’s one funny face!

Okay, why not? I’ll go with you guys.

Donald Duck.

Name’s Goofy.

I’m Sora.

All for one, one for all.

That little squirt took down that Heartless! Who’d have thought it?

Such is the power of the Keyblade. The child’s strength is not his own.

Why don’t we turn him into a Heartless?

That’ll settle things quick enough.

And the brat’s friends are the king’s lackeys. Swoggle me eyes, they’re all bilge rats by the look of them.

You’re no prize yourself.

Shut up!

Enough.

The Keyblade has chosen him. Will it be he who conquers the darkness? Or will the darkness swallow him? Either way, he could be quite useful.

Make sure you’re prepared for the journey ahead of you. We don’t know how far the Heartless have spread.

Check out the shops here. They’ve got some pretty neat stuff!

This is from all of us.

Spend it as you see fit. And this is from Leon.

Good luck!

I hope you find your friends.

Look out for each other. Keep your spirits up.

The gummi ship is outside that gate.

The what?

That’s our ship.

Wait ‘til you see it!

Hold on. Sora, this is for you.

Now you can use magic, too. Goofy, give him that other thing.

What?

You know!

Oh, yeah.

Abilities allow you to do all sorts of things. Guess we should look for ‘em along the way, huh?

Okay, is that it? Let’s get going!

Not ‘til we’re ready!

Well, I see big adventures coming their way! Looks like it’s up to me to keep track of it all in my journal!

There are Dalmatians named Pongo and Perdita living in the Second District...

What’s wrong?

They’re quite upset, these Dalmatians. They’ve lost their puppies.

Squall can’t stop worrying about them.

Call me Leon.

Sora, would you look for the puppies?

Help them out.

Please, find the puppies for him.

Squa--I mean, Leon--is really cute sometimes.

We travel to different worlds on the gummi ship.

The Heartless ships often give us a hard time.

Always be on the lookout during flight.

Your journey will be documented until you reach your destination.

Seek out the missions each world has to offer!

Oh, my fur and whiskers! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!

Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I’m here, I should be there.

I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! The queen, she’ll have my head for sure!

How did he get so small?

No, you’re simply too big.

It talks!

Must you be so loud? You woke me up.

Good morning.

Good night! I need a bit more sleep.

Wait, what do we have to do to grow small?

Why don’t you try the bottle...over there?

Court is now in session!

I’m on trial? But why?

Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, presiding!

This girl is the culprit. There’s no doubt about it. And the reason is...because, I say so, that’s why!

That is so unfair!

Well, have you anything to say in your defense?

Of course! I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong!

You may be queen, but I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to be so...so mean!

Silence! You dare defy me?

Hey, guys, we should help her out.

Yeah, but the--

We’re outsiders, so wouldn’t that be muddling?


!

Oh, yeah. A-hyuck! And that’s against the rules.

The court finds the defendant...

Guilty as charged!

For the crimes of assault and attempted theft of my heart...

Off with her head!

No! No! Oh, please!

Hold it right there!

Who are you? How dare you interfere with my court?

Excuse me. But we know who the real culprit is!

Uh-huh. It’s the Heartle—

Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for.

That’s nonsense. Have you any proof?

Bring me evidence of Alice’s innocence! Fail, and it’s off with all of your heads! Gather as much or little evidence as you please. Report back here once you’re ready.

Who are you?

I’m Sora.

I’m Goofy, and that there’s Donald.

Pleased to meet you, though I do wish it were under better circumstances. I’m sorry you got mixed up in this nonsense.

Why are you on trial in the first place?

I should like to know the very same thing! Apparently I was guilty from the moment I took the stand!

That’s crazy! So, where are you from?

Hmm, curious. I can’t quite remember. You see, I found this mysterious rabbit hole. When I tried to peek inside, I tumbled in head over heels... And I found myself here.

So you’re from another world!

That’s funny. Maybe you don’t need a ship, then.

I don’t get it.

What do you mean
?

Enough! The defendant will be silent!

Who are you?

Who, indeed? Poor Alice. Soon to lose her head, and she’s not guilty of a thing!

Hey, if you know who the culprit is, tell us!

The Cheshire Cat has all the answers—but doesn’t always tell. The answer, the culprit, the cat all lie in darkness.

Wait!

They’ve already left the forest. I won’t tell which exit. There are four pieces of evidence in all. Three are a cinch to find. The fourth is tricky. Big reward if you find them all.

Should we trust him?

To trust, or not to trust? I trust you’ll decide!

Well, look what you’ve found. Nice going.

Now we can save Alice.

Don’t be so sure! She may be innocent, but what about you?

What do you mean?

I won’t tell. But I’ll give you something.

Are you ready to present evidence before the queen?

Yes.

Very well. Counsel, step up to the podium.

Now, show me what you have found.

Well, that’s certainly a lot of evidence, but I’m still not impressed. Cards! Bring forth my evidence!

Hmm, checking all five would only be a waste of time. All right, then. Choose the one you wish to present. I’ll decide who’s guilty based on that evidence.

What? After all the trouble of collecting it?

You dare object? Then you will lose your head! Now, choose! One box!

Are you certain? No second chances!

I’m sure.

Now we shall see who the real culprit is.

What in the world was that?

There’s your evidence. Alice is innocent.

Rrrrrrrgh... Silence! I’m the law here!

Article 29: Anyone who defies the queen is guilty!

That’s crazy!

Seize them at once!

Cards! If they touch the tower, you lose your heads!

Get them, you fools! Quit joking around!

Why, you!

She must’ve gotten kidnapped while we were fighting.

You fools!

Find the one who’s behind this! I don’t care how!

I just looked away for a moment, and...

Have you seen Alice?

Alice, no. Shadows, yes!

Where did they go?

This way? That way? Does it matter? Left, right, up, down! All mixed up thanks to the shadows! Step deeper into the forest to the deserted garden. You might find shadows in the upside-down room!

Give me a potion and I’ll make you bigger.

They’re hiding somewhere. And the momeraths outgrabe. Want to find the shadows? Try turning on the light.

It’s too dim. Make it brighter.

What next?

One more lamp that you need to light.

All the lights are on. You’ll see the shadows soon. They’ll arise in this room, but somewhere else. The shadows might go after that doorknob, too.

You’ll have a better view from higher up.

The shadows should be here soon.

Are you prepared for the worst? If not, too bad!

What a racket. How’s a doorknob to get any sleep?

What was that?

You hear that? Sounded like something closed.

This gummi ain’t like the others. No, sir.

Okay, I’ll hold on to it.

Splendid. You’re quite the hero. If you’re looking for Alice, she’s not here. She’s gone! Off with the shadows, into darkness.

No...

Let’s go back to our gummi ship. We might find her in another world.

We've gotta go to a save point to return to our ship.

Um...

Good timing. Give me a hand, will ya? Move that pedestal over there for me.

I gotta spruce this place up for the games.

It weighs a ton!

It’s way too heavy!

What? Too heavy? Since when have you been such a little—

Oh. Wrong guy. What’re you doing here?

This here’s the world-famous Coliseum—heroes only! And I got my hands full preparing for the games. So run along, pip-squeaks.

Look, it’s like this.

Heroes are coming from all over to fight ferocious monsters right here in the Coliseum.

You’ve got heroes standing right in front of you.

Yup. He’s a real hero chosen by the Keyblade!

And we’re heroes, too.

Hero? That runt?

What’s so funny? I’ve fought a bunch of monsters!

Hey, if you can’t even move this...

You can’t call yourself...

A hero!

Okay, so it takes more than brawn.

Well, well, let’s see what you can do. This trial is tough. You got what it takes? You ready?

I’m ready!

Okay, kid. Let’s see what you’ve got.

The rules are simple: Bust all the barrels within the time limit. Ready? Go!

Not bad! For a beginner, that is.

Hey, you’re better than I thought!

You know, you ain’t bad, kid.

Looks like I’m headed for the games.

Afraid not.

Why not?

Two words: You guys ain’t heroes.

Come on!

Wanna become a real hero? Start by mastering this spell.

Rather a stubborn old goat, wouldn’t you say?

Who are you?

Whoa, hold on there, fuzz boy. Wait, let me guess. You want to enter the games, right?

Well, then, hey, get a load of this.

A pass?

It’s all yours.

Good luck, kid. I’m pulling for you, little shorty.

Hey, how’d you get this?

Can we enter the games now?

Well... I guess so. We start with the preliminaries! Some real weirdos signed up for the games. Better watch yourself.

You’re no heroes yet, but you ain’t doing bad. Lucky you came to me for coaching.

Something tells me he’ll be a tough one to beat. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up facing him.

Say, you’re better than I thought, kid! Wish he was here to see this.

Who?

Hercules. He’s a hero if ever there was one. Too bad he’s off visiting his father.

That little punk is your next opponent, okay?

Now, don’t blow it. Just take him out.

The great god of the Underworld is afraid of a kid? Sorry, but my contract says—

I know! You think I don’t know? I wrote the contract! I know it says you’re only required to kill Hercules in this tournament. But you’ve gotta fight that kid to get to him. Come on.

Hey, it’s like that old goat says: Rule 11: It’s all just a game, so let loose and have fun with it!

I mean, a casualty along the way is no big deal, right?

Geez. Stiffer than the stiffs back home. Still, suckers like him are hard to come by...

That’s the best you can do?

Oh, right, there was one other rule I forgot: Accidents happen.

Herc!

Phil, get them out of here!

Whew, that was close! That was Cerberus, the guardian of the Underworld. Herc should be able to handle him. But then again, maybe not... This doesn’t look good. I hope Herc’s okay. Wish I could go in!

Kid, you’re not entering the arena, are ya? This ain’t just some match. This is for real!

I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or not.

Careful, kid!

Kid, I got two words of advice for you: Attack!

Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes, and confer upon thee full rights and privileges to participate in the games. Further—

Hey! What do you mean
?

You rookies still don’t understand what it takes to be a true hero.

So, what does it take?

Well, that’s just something you’ll have to find out for yourselves. Just the way that I did.

No problem. We’ll start by proving ourselves in the games.

There ain’t gonna be any games for a while.

Gotta clean up the mess from that last battle first.

Okay, we’ll be back.

I still can’t believe that squirt actually beat Cerberus.

Just between us, I’d already worn Cerberus down by the time the little guy jumped in.

My lips are sealed.

Hey, are you all right?

Yeah.

So why did you go along with him, anyway?

I’m looking for someone. Hades promised to help. I tried to exploit the power of darkness, but it backfired.

I fell into darkness, and I couldn’t find the light.

You’ll find it. I’m searching, too.

For your light?

Don’t lose sight of it.

How about a rematch sometime? Fair and square, no dark powers involved.

I think I’ll pass.

He’s strong, he’s kind.

He’s always there for you, and he’s handsome to boot.

He’s perfect. Perfect. Perfectly infuriating! He makes me crazy.

Wait a minute. What are you worried about? All the pieces are in place. Relax. Here’s what you do. Let Hercules train the kid. In the next games, I’ll take care of them both.

Who invited you to the party? Stay out of this. This is my show.

As you wish. Fight to your heart’s content.

Hey, Donald, maybe King Mickey’s down there.

In a backwater place like that? No way! Let’s move on.

Hold on. Riku and Kairi might be down there. Let’s just check it out.

Forget it! We’re on an important mission!

Just land!

No!

Come on!

Aw, phooey!

We’re landing!

Don’t touch that! Nooo!

Oww...my head...

Donald? Goofy?

Sabor, danger.

Um...thank you.

Thank you.

Huh? Uh, what is this place?

This place, this place.

Okaaay... Where did the others go?

Look, I got separated from my friends. Have you seen them?

Friends...

Friends!

Right, my friends! There’s two of ‘em. The loud one is Dona—

You know what? Never mind. I’m looking for my friends, Riku and Kairi.

Look for Riku, friends?

Right!

Kairi, friends?

Uhh...right...

Friends here.

Really!?

Huh?

Friends here.

Not sure I understand, but show me! Take me to Riku and Kairi!

Tarzan. Tarzan go.

And I’m...Sora. Tarzan go, Sora go go!

Gawrsh, where are we?

I sure hope Sora’s okay.

Aw, who needs him? We can find the king without him.

Huh?

Jane!

Tarzan!

Oh, and who is this?

Uh, hi there. I’m—

Oh, you speak English! So, then, obviously, you’re not related to Tarzan...

Are you here to study the gorillas?

Highly doubtful.

Sora!

Goofy! Donald!

A circus of clowns. Not much use for hunting gorillas.

Mr. Clayton, we’re studying them, not hunting them. This is research.

Well, the more the merrier. Do make yourselves at home.

Well, anyway...

I’m staying.

Huh?

Sora, look what we found. Look at this.

What’s that?

A gummi block. It’s the same stuff used to build our ship.

So that means...

The king could be here. So, we’ve gotta work together to look for him. For now.

Fine. I’ll let you tag along. For now.

Apparently Tarzan was raised in the jungle by the gorillas. Communicating with him still isn’t easy, but he’s learning.

So he was speaking in
back there...

Ah, that’s right. You’re looking for your friends?

He said Riku and Kairi are here. And one word I couldn’t understand...

Why don’t we try this? We’ll show Tarzan some slides and see if any of them match that word. Oh, what happened to the slides?

Clayton’s the name. I’m a hunter, not a researcher. What? No, I am not trying to hunt the gorillas. But they’re so rare! I’d just like to get a look at them.

What’s wrong, Sora?

What? Um...nothing. (thinking) This place... It just looks so familiar. But how? I’ve never been off my island.

Well, Tarzan?

Where are my friends, Riku and Kairi?

Hey, I thought—

That leaves just one place.

Young man, we’ve been in this jungle for some time now. But we have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re with the gorillas. But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.

Really, Mr. Clayton. Tarzan wouldn’t hide—

Then take us there! Take us to the gorillas.

Go-ril-las.

Tarzan...are you sure?

Tarzan go see Kerchak.

Kerchak?

He must be the leader. Perfect. I’ll go along as an escort. After all, the jungle is a dangerous place.

Kerchak, please listen to me. I know the nesting ground is secret, but I trust them. You see, I want to help them because...because... well, they need us.

Uh... Did you get that?

No.

Kerchak.

Kerchak...

He seemed sorta distracted by something.

Was he looking toward the tree house?

What’s the big idea?

Wait, Kerchak. Please!

You don’t understand. I was only trying to... Ah. A snake slithered by, you see. I saved that poor gorilla’s life.

How could you do such a thing!

Now, Miss Porter, as I told you, I was not aiming at the gorilla.

You are not to go near the gorillas again!

All because of one mishap? Come, now...

What am I doing with these imbeciles?

Blasted gorillas! I’ll hunt down every last one of them! I’ll track them down somehow.

I’ll stake my life on it.

Heartless!

Don’t mind Mr. Clayton. He’s not a bad person—just a bit impetuous.

I do hope Mr. Clayton is safe...

Hey, where’s Jane?

What’s wrong, Tarzan?

Something coming. Jane, danger. Jane near... Near tree house.

Sounds like trouble. Let’s go.

Tarzan!

Clayton came to the tent, and... That’s the last thing I remember.

Clayton?

Gorillas trapped. Terk ran.

We must help the gorillas!

No!

Clayton?

Not Clayton!

Not Clayton!

Lazy beast!

Tarzan, home.

This is your home? But that means...

Huh?

The waterfalls... They’re echoing all the way here.

Friends there. See friends.

Oh, now I’ve got it. (recites Mangani word) means heart. Friends in our hearts...

Heart...

Oh, so that’s what it meant.

Friends, same heart. Clayton, lose heart. No heart, no see friends. No heart, no friends.

Sorry about what I said.

I’m sorry too.

Yeah. All for one, huh?

A gummi!

But it’s sure not thing king’s.

I think someone has a new admirer.

No, no, no, no! Daisy would kill me!

What drew the Heartless to that world?

The hunter lured them there. It was his lust for power that was the bait. But it seems the bait was too tasty for his own good.

Yeah, he got chomped instead!

A weak-hearted fool like him stood no chance against the Heartless. But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.

Fear not. It will take him ages to find the rest.

Besides, he remains blissfully unaware of our other plan.

Yes, the princesses...

They are falling into our hands, one by one. Speaking of which...

Well, guess we’d better get going.

Where is your ship, anyway?

Well, uh... Not too far.

Sora, Tarzan, friends

The gummi block that came out of that glowing hole... It’s not like the others. Wonder what it’s used for.

I dunno.

Maybe Leon’ll know.

Hmm... He might. Back to Traverse Town, then?

I wanna be pilot!

Hey, stop it!

Oh, come on! I’m the Keyblade master.

I don’t care who you are! No!

Here we go again...

Leon’s probably at the underground cavern. He trains there often. You know, the channel in the alleyway is connected to the cavern.

So, you found the Keyhole.

Yeah. The Keyblade locked it automatically.

Good.

Every world among the stars has a Keyhole. And each one leads to the heart of that world. There must be one in this town as well.

What do you mean?

It was in Ansem’s report.

The Heartless enter through the Keyhole and do something to the world’s core.

What happens to the world?

In the end, it disappears.

What!

That’s why your key is so important.

Please lock the Keyholes. You’re the only one who can.

I don’t know...

Seeing other worlds would probably serve you well.

Yeah!

We gotta find your friends! And King Mickey!

I guess you’re right... Okay!

Hey, Leon. This gummi block’s different from the others. Do you know what it’s for?

Ask Cid. He should know.

Wait, Sora. Take this with you.

This stone holds some mysterious power. I’ve been carrying it for luck. I want you to hold onto it.

How do you use it?

Uh, Leon?

A big tournament is being held somewhere, kupo.

What’ve you got there? Hey! Well, if it ain’t a gummi block.

Yup.

What’s this one for?

You’re kiddin’ me! You’re flyin’ a gummi ship and you don’t know nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace ain’t no playground.

There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the gummi ship to go to other worlds. We don’t have a choice.

Whoa, easy.

I didn’t know. No hard feelings, all right? Well, I guess I could lend y’all a hand, then.

Thanks.

Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new places. You want one on your ship, right?

I’ll install it for you. But I got this thing I gotta go deliver first.

What do you need to deliver?

Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it in, it was practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way it was. But overall, I did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway, you mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s the old house past the Third District. Look for a big fire sign.

Wh-What was that?

Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it out if you want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop by the house in the Third District. I’ll be there.

There’s something about this musty place...

It reminds me of the secret place back home, where we used to scribble on the walls. Remember?

Kairi?

Sora?

Well, well.

You’ve arrived sooner than I expected.

Wha... You knew we were coming?

Of course.

Are you...a Heartless?

He doesn’t look like one.

Oh, my. No. My name is Merlin. As you can see, I am a sorcerer. I spend much of my time traveling. It’s good to be home. Your king has requested my help.

King Mickey?

Yes, indeed. Donald, Goofy. And who might you be, young man?

I’m Sora.

Ah. So, you have found the key.

What did the king ask you to do?

Just a moment...

Presto!

There, now. Ahem.

Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic. We can start anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the training. Oh, and one more thing.

Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to help, too. I will assist throughout your journey.

I do not know how much I can be of help, but do stop by anytime.

Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this. Thank you. You wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know, myself. In fact, it’s not mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one day. It was such a curious book, I asked Cid to repair it for me. Well, I guess I’ll put it here somewhere, for now. This book holds a great secret. The missing pages will unlock it.

I’ll leave the book over there. Do look at it whenever you like. My best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that stone of yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.

Do you know what this is?

Oh, the poor thing! He has turned into a summon gem.

A summon gem?

This little creature lived in a world that was consumed by darkness. When a world vanishes, so do its inhabitants. But this one has such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with his world.

Can he regain himself?

Yes, but only his spirit. Now, watch!

Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

Whenever you call, he will help you. If you find any more of these, bring them to me. Don’t worry, when their worlds are restored they will return there. Sora, please help save them.

Don’t worry, I will.

Think, think. Think, think.

Hi there. What’s wrong?

Nothing. Just thinking.

Oh.

I was thinking of how to say goodbye to Pooh.

Pooh?

Yes?

Wait a second. You’re Pooh?

Yes, I’m Winnie the Pooh. Pooh for short. Who are you?

I’m Sora.

Oh. Hello, Sora. Have you come to say goodbye to Pooh, too?

Well, no. Why would I do that? We’ve only just met.

Because everyone’s gone away.

What do you mean?

Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And we’d take walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some honey. Just one small smackeral would taste very good right now.

But now everyone’s gone. All my friends, and my favorite Hunny Tree too. Everyone must’ve gone away while I was napping, I think... So, who knows?

Maybe I shall end up going away somewhere as well. But I wonder, how do I say goodbye to myself?

Think, think, think.

Oh, my tumbly is getting rather rumbly.

Oh, bother. There’s no more honey left. If only the Hunny Tree would visit... Then I could eat my fill.

Let me guess: You’d like to know what happens next. Unfortunately, some of the pages are missing, so I can’t tell you yet. The pages are scattered over many worlds. Would you find them for us?

You’d best go see Cid before going anywhere else.

There you are. What’s going on?

Riku!

Hey, hey, cut it out.

I’m not dreaming this time, right?

I hope not. Took forever to find you.

Riku!

Wait a second, where’s Kairi?

Isn’t she with you?

Well, don’t worry. I’m sure she made it off the island, too.

We’re finally free. Hey, she might even be looking for us now.

We’ll all be together again soon. Don’t worry. Just leave everything to me. I know this—

Leave it to who?

Sora, what did you—

I’ve been looking for you and Kairi, too, with their help.

Who are they?

Ahem. My name is—

We’ve visited so many places and worlds, looking for you.

Really? Well, what do you know? I never would have guessed.

Oh, and guess what? Sora’s the Keyblade master.

Who would’ve thought it?

What’s that mean?

So, this is called a Keyblade?

Huh?

Hey, give it back.

Catch!

Whoa!

Okay, so you’re coming with us, right? We’ve got this awesome rocket. Wait ‘til you see it!

No, he can’t come!

What?

Forget it!

Oh, come on! He’s my friend!

I don’t care!

Huh? He’s gone.

Riku?

Nice going. Oh, well. At least, he’s okay.

And who knows? Maybe we’ll run into Kairi soon, too.

You guys ever hear of Maleficent?

I hear she’s in town.

Who is she?

A witch, man, she’s a witch!

She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t take her lightly.

She’s been using the Heartless for years.

We lost our world, thanks to her.

One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!

That was nine years ago.

I got out of that mess and came here with these guys.

That’s awful!

Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his life to studying the Heartless.

His report should tell us how to get rid of the Heartless.

Where’s this report?

We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was destroyed.

I’m sure Maleficent’s got most of the pages.

You see? It’s just as I told you. While you toiled away trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some new companions. Evidently, now he values them far more than he does you.

You’re better off without that wretched boy.

Now, think no more of him and come with me. I’ll help you find what you’re searching for...

So, you delivered that book? That navigation gummi’s installed and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw in a warp gummi for the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been to before. Well, better get back to my real job. What’s my real job? You’ll see. See me at the First District.

I’ve been thinking about the bell in the Second District.

That one that rang a bit ago?

The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about it, you know.

But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.

Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if anything happens.

Hey, now that was quick! Now you know. I’m in the gummi block business. Workin’ on your gummi ship sure was great. Come again and I’ll give you a big discount.

Go ahead, take it. It’s a special giveaway.

Hey, got another navigation gummi there, eh? I’ll bet you want it installed.

Yeah, please.

Hmm... Looks like this is another one of those blocks that come in sets. You gotta find the mate to this one.

Well, well, as I live and breathe! If it isn’t Pinocchio!

Oh. Hi, Jiminy.

What in the world are you doing down here?

Um... Playing hide-and-seek.

I just don’t believe it. And here I was, up all night, just worried sick about you. Why of all the—

Pinocchio!

Pinocchio! Are you telling me the truth?

Yes!

Then tell me, what is this?

It was a present.

No fibbing, now! You know you’re not supposed to tell lies. A lie only grows and grows, ‘til you get caught! Plain as the nose on your face!

But if you want something, why wait? Why not just take it?

Oh, my! Who told you that? You need some advice from your conscience!

That’s right! You’re my conscience, Jiminy! I’ll never tell lies as long as you’re around.

You need to be good so you can become a real boy. You promised Geppetto you would be, right?

Oh! Do you know where Father is?

He’s not with you?

Jiminy, let’s go find Father!

Now, hold on! There are all sorts of dangers and temptations out there! I’ll go find Geppetto, so you just wait here. These fellows here will be helping me.

We will?

Well, shall we go, Sora?

You could’ve asked us first...

I never thought you’d do it. Not bad.

Phil, you’re just as stubborn as ever. Don’t pretend you’re not happy for them!

Ahem! Now, kid, you’ve still got a long way to go. The next round’s startin’ soon. Next time it’ll be the real thing.

And the Keyhole?

The Heartless are searching for it now. I’m certain we’ll find it soon enough. So that just leaves...

Jafar! I’ve looked everywhere for Jasmine. She’s disappeared like magic!

The girl is more trouble than she’s worth.

You said you had things under control.

Agrabah is full of holes for rats to hide in. But why worry about Princess Jasmine? With her or without her, surely this world will be ours when we find the Keyhole.

We need all seven princesses of heart to open the final door. Any fewer is useless.

Well, if the princess is that important, we’ll find her.

Find Jasmine and bring her to me at once.

Don’t steep yourself in darkness too long. The Heartless consume the careless.

Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary.

Who’s there? Hello?

I’m Jasmine. My father is the sultan of Agrabah.

Uh... So that makes you a princess.

But he has been deposed by Jafar, who now controls the city.

Jafar?

You haven’t heard of him? He’s the royal vizier. He’s gained evil powers and seized Agrabah. He’s desperately looking for something— something he calls the
Jafar caught me trying to escape, but he helped me.

Who helped you?

We were hiding nearby, but he left a while ago to take care of something... Oh, I hope Aladdin’s all right.

Aladdin? Where might I find this street rat?

Jasmine, allow me to find you more suitable company, my dear princess. These little rats won’t do, you see.

Jasmine, run!

Ah, the boy who holds the key.

The carpet flew off toward the desert. Let’s follow it, Sora!

Gawrsh, not again!

Genie, get rid of these guys!

Wish Number One, coming right up!

I see... Thanks, Sora.

Aladdin, what’re you doing out here?

Same old stuff. Hunting legendary treasure. Just paid a visit to the Cave of Wonders.

I found that magic carpet, and this lamp.

Legend has it that whoever holds the lamp can summon the—

Please, kid, leave the intros to a professional. (winking) The one and only GENIE OF THE LAMP!

Rub-a-dub-dub the lamp and have your dearest wishes granted.

Today’s winner is...Aladdin! Congratulations!

Any wish?

Patience, my fine feathered friend.

Any three wishes ! A one wish (one genie disappears), a two wish (two disappear), a three wish. Then I make like a banana and split!

Our lucky winner made his first wish—

And let me tell you, what a doozy that wish was—

So he has two left.

So, master, what’ll you have for Wish Number Two?

Hmm, how about making me a fabulously wealthy prince?

Oooh! Money! Royalty! Fame!

Okay, you asked for it! A hundred servants and a hundred camels loaded with gold!

Just say the word and I’ll deliver it in 30 minutes or less, or your meal’s free.

Hey, I’ll even throw in a cappuccino!

No, thanks!

Okay.

I think I’ll put that on hold until we reach Agrabah.

Uh, why a prince?

You see, there’s this girl in Agrabah named Jasmine. But she’s a princess, and I’m... Aww, she could never fall for a guy like me.

Oh. Princess?

Jasmine?

Oh, that’s right! She’s in trouble, Aladdin!

What? Well, c’mon, let’s get going!

Ah, fresh air! The great outdoors!

I guess you don’t get out much, huh?

Comes with the job. Phenomenal cosmic powers. Itty-bitty living space. It’s always three wishes, then back to my portable prison. I’m lucky to see the light of day every century or two...

Say, Genie, what if I use my last wish to free you from the lamp? What do you think?

You’d do that?

Genie, it’s a promise. After we help Jasmine.

So, Jafar is after Jasmine and this


Keyhole, eh? I could swear I’ve heard about that somewhere before...

Really? Where?

Now, where was it? It’s only been 200 years...

Well, anyway, we’ve got to stop Jafar before it’s too late.

Setting your sights a little high, aren’t you boy? Back to your hole, street rat. I will not allow you to trouble the princess any more.

Jasmine!

I’m so sorry, Aladdin.

Genie, help Jasmine, please!

One wish left! You’re making this really easy, you know.

So sorry, boy. I’m afraid your second wish has been denied.

I’m sorry, Al.

And now, I bid you all farewell. Attack!

Courage!

Jasmine!

To the desert! Come on, let’s move!

My first wish, Genie! Show me the Keyhole!

That boy again?

He’s more persistent than I expected. Why not explain the situation to that boy Riku? Doing so may actually prove useful to our--

Wait a second. Are you Maleficent?

Jafar, let Jasmine go!

Not a chance.

You see, she’s a princess—one of seven who somehow hold the key to opening the door.

Open...

...the door?

But you fools won’t live to see what lies beyond it. Genie! My second wish. Crush them!

Genie, no!

Sorry, Al. The one with the lamp calls the shots. I don’t have a choice.

I’m really sorry about this. Run!

Genie!

My final wish! I want you to make me and all-powerful genie!

The lamp! Get Jafar’s lamp!

Iago! Keep the lamp away from them!

Yeah, yeah, I hear you!

Nag, nag! It’s all he ever does!

Ugh! Is it hot in here, or is it just me?

Water! Water!

Keep moving!

I don’t need your help, all right!

Okay, Jafar! Back to your lamp!

Jasmine? Jasmine!

Whoa, we’d better get out of here!

Jasmine!

So, Jasmine’s no longer in Agrabah. Sora, let’s go find her.

Sorry. I can’t take you with me.

Wh-Why not?

I sure wish we could...

But we can’t. If we take him to another world, we would be...

Muh... Mudd—

Meddling!

Aladdin, we’ll find Jasmine. I promise.

Uh, earth to Al. Hello? You still have one wish left. Look, just say the word. Ask me to find Jasmine for you.

I...I wish...

For your freedom, Genie.

Al!

A deal’s a deal, Genie. Now you can go anywhere you want. You’re your own master. But if you can, it’d be great if you could go along with them and help Sora find Jasmine.

Sorry, Al. I’m done taking orders from others. But... A favor, now that’s entirely different.

I guess I could give that a try.

After all, we’re pals, right, Al?

Genie...

Just leave it to me!

That smarmy vizier could’ve had ‘em—if someone had stuck around to give him a hand.

Hey, I did my part. I brought the princess, didn’t I?

Jafar was beyond help, consumed by his own hatred. One should beware of letting it burn too fiercely.

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lighten up. I’m as cool as they come, okay? By the way, kid, have we got something special for you.

Huh?

We had a deal, yes? You help us, and we grant you your wish...

Kairi!

Go to her. Your vessel is waiting.

Just remember, this is no pleasure cruise. It won’t be a pleasant voyage.

Why are you doing all this for me? What’s the catch?

Catch? What’s the catch?

Silly, boy. You’re like a son to me. I only want you to be happy.

I seriously doubt that.

Believe what you wish. But lest we forget, I kept my end of the bargain.

Here. Take this with you.

Sora, please find Jasmine for me.

Could this torn page be from Merlin’s book?

Let’s return to town and give it to him.

Hello, i-is anyone there?

Wh-Wh-What am I to do? I’m all alone. (calling) Pooh? Pooh? Where are you? It’s me, Piglet.

Oh dear! I was j-just... N-Never mind. I’m sorry!

Don’t be scared. You’re looking for Pooh, right?

You know Pooh?

Oh, y-you see, I-I have something for him. I have to take it to Pooh right away!

Oh, Pooh!

Oh, I believe I smell a delicious something—a something like honey!

Pooh!

Hello, Piglet. How have you been?

Oh, I-I’m so glad to see you. I thought you’d gone away. I brought wh-what you asked for.

Thank you, Piglet. Now I can finally have some honey.

Really? B-But how?

I shall hold on to the balloon, and fly like a bee up the Hunny Tree, see.

But if you take their honey, won’t the bees be angry?

Hmm...

Oh!

If you could only chase away those bees, I’m quite certain I could get a small morsel of honey. Would you help me get some honey?

Sure!

Oh. Hello there, Owl.

Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to get some honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.

Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree with his balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you see here.

There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets too close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to Pooh, they’ll pop his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. The more time Pooh has at each hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s more honey higher up, too. If jumping from branch to branch proves difficult, try the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to Pooh quickly. But it isn’t fully reliable. Good luck.

It is rather funny what I will do for honey.

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

What is that?

Wow, it’s huge!

It’s a giant whale!

It’s Monstro! He’s a whale of a whale, and vicious besides!

Whoa! Sora, get us out of here!

Too late! He’s going to swallow us!

It’s true! I saw it with my own eyes!

You sure you didn’t just hear it this time?

What difference does it make? There’s a huge monster in there, I tell you!

All right. Suppose there really is a monster... Think we can beat it by ourselves, Sora?

No problem. Let’s do it!

Listen! There! Can you hear it growling?

Shh, quiet.

We’ve gotta be careful.

See that? It was just the wind making that noise.

Aw, man. I wish it was a monster! Hold on! What’s that over there?

A window, or maybe a door? It won’t open.

Geez, is that really all that’s in here?

What do you expect in a boring place like this?

Hey, Sora.

Hm?

When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!

Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? Did you hear?

Knock it off!

Hey, Sora. Are you okay?

What are you guys doing? Where are we, anyway?

Whoa!

Uh, ya know, I think that big ol’ whale Monstro just swallowed us. And for today’s weather: expect showers.

Heavy showers!

Hey! Who’s there?

It’s me.

Oh, it’s just Pinocchio. ...Pinocchio!?

Pinocchio?

Pinocch, where are you going? Pinocch! Come on, everybody! After him! Quick!

What have you got there, Pinocchio?

With this, we can get out of her, Father.

Really? With this big block? You think so?

It’s true.

So, how did you end up here, Pinocchio?

Oh, my. So the whale swallowed all of you, too? My goodness.

Yeah, looks like it.

My name is Geppetto. I’m Pinocchio’s father. When we got separated, I traveled all over, looking for him.

Thank goodness we’re together again.

So, you seem to know Pinocchio quite well. I hope he was a good boy in my absence.

Well, we’ve all had quite a journey. Right, Pinocchio?

Pinocchio? I warned him not to wander off here. He can be a naughty boy. Even so, he’s very precious to me.

What are you doing? Come on, let’s go back.

You know, Geppetto’s awfully worried about you.

Pinocchio, stop fooling around! This is no time for games!

But, Sora, I thought you liked games.

Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?

Riku! Wh-What are you doing here?

Just playing with Pinocchio.

You know what I mean! What about Kairi? Did you find her?

Maybe. Catch us and maybe I’ll tell you what I know.

Come on!

Why do you still care about that boy? He has all but deserted you for the Keyblade and his new companions, after all.

I don’t care about him. I was just messing with him a little.

Oh, really? Of course you were.

Beware the darkness in your heart. The Heartless prey upon it.

Mind your own business.

Riku! What’s the matter with you? What are you thinking? Don’t you realize what you’re doing?

I was about to ask you the same thing, Sora. You only seem interested in running around and showing off that Keyblade these days. Do you even want to save Kairi?

I do.

You up for this?

No problem. Let’s do it!

Get me out of here!

Help! It’s scary in here!

Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Please! Give me back my son!

Sorry, old man. I have some unfinished business with this puppet.

He’s no puppet! Pinocchio is my little boy!

He is unusual. Not many puppets have hearts. I’m not sure, but maybe he can help someone who’s lost theirs.

Wait a minute. Are you talking about Kairi?

What do you care about her?

Hey, let Pinocchio go, Riku.

A puppet that’s lost its heart to the Heartless... Maybe it holds the key to helping Kairi. How about it, Sora? Let’s join forces to save her. We can do it, together.

What? You’d rather fight me? Over a puppet that has no heart?

Heart or no heart, at least he still has a conscience.

Conscience?

You might not hear it, but right now it’s loud and clear. And it’s telling me you’re on the wrong side!

Then you leave me no choice.

Pinocchio! Pinocchio!

Jiminy... I’m not gonna make it.

Oh! I guess I’m okay!

Run!

Riku! Riku, where are you?

So, Kairi’s like a lifeless puppet now?

Precisely.

And her heart was...

Taken by the Heartless, no doubt.

Tell me! What can I do?

There are seven maidens of the purest heart. We call them the princesses of heart. Gather them together, and a door will open to the heart of all worlds. Within lies untold wisdom. There, you will surely find a way to recover Kairi’s heart. Now, I’ll grant you a marvelous gift.

The power to control the Heartless.

Soon, Kairi. Soon.

I sure hope Pinocchio and Geppetto are okay.

Yeah, hopefully they landed safely somewhere.

Riku...

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.

Nobody’s home! And I’m out of honey!

Look, Rabbt’s house c-came back! But it looks like Rabbit isn’t home. Pooh’s been calling and calling, but the house says no one’s there.

Nobody’s home?

That’s right, Nobody!

Who is this person named Nobody?

Nobody, have you seen Rabbit?

No! No Rabbit here! There’s no one here!

Hello, Rabbit!

Why, P-Pooh. What a pleasant surprise... Nice to see you, too, Piglet. And...

Is this a new friend? P-Pooh, I’m sorry, but... I’m all out of honey at the moment.

Sora, do you smell honey?

H-Honey? Now, how did that get up there? Would you like some Pooh? Don’t feel you have to, of course.

Oh, thank you, Rabbit. I would like just a small smackeral. I’m quite hungry.

Um, Pooh Bear...

You’re not eating the whole pot, are you?

Once you start, there’s no stopping you, is there...

Ohh... Out of honey again.

H-Help! Please help Pooh!

Oh, help and bother. I’m stuck again. I came in through this hole, so it must have shrunk.

Oh, wh-what to do?

All this because he can’t stop liking honey so much!

Oh, how will I eat honey if I’m stuck here? When it’s lunch time, perhaps you could bring me a honey jar.

No honey ‘til you’re unstuck!

If Pooh doesn’t slim down, my house will stay plugged up forever! If only there were something we could do...

Wait, I know! A bit of carrot top juice will do the trick! I have a carrot patch on the other side of the stream. Carrot top juice is just the ticket to slimming down a Pooh!

Oh, no!

Hey, there! Name’s Tigger! T-I-double-guh-RR. That spells Tigger!

Well, now! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before!

Hello, Tigger. You’ve just bounced my new friend Sora.

Hey, Pooh! Say, you’re lookin’ mighty uncomfy today. Is that some new exercise? Why, bouncin’ around is a lot more fun.

Wh-Why do you bounce around so much, Tigger?

Why? ‘Cause bouncin’ is what Tiggers do best!

Speaking of which, my bouncin’ spot has gone and disappeared! So for now, this’ll be my new bouncin’ ground.

Tigger’s bouncing will ruin my vegetables! And if we don’t give Pooh some carrot top juice, he’ll be stuck forever.

Please help me! Keep Tigger away from my carrots!

This is quite a fix. But I have just the solution. Pay attention, now.

Sora, you’ll have to protect this carrot patch. If Tigger bounces on a carrot twice, it’ll be buried.

Once...

Twice!

Just like that. Protect the carrots from Tigger’s bounces and you’ll receive points. How you ask? It’s elementary!

Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them. There are fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and how many times you block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.

The Rush command is the key to a high score. Select Rush while near a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area before Tigger lands. Well, good luck!

How about those bounceroonies? They were good even for a Tigger.

Thank you so much. Now I’d better make that carrot top juice. I’ll get the carrots, so please wait inside the house.

Oh, what a day! I gave Pooh the carrot top juice. All we have to do now is push him out. Just a little push should do.

First my vegetable patch and now this...

Oh, bother. Where am I? It’s ever so dark in here. Well, it isn’t so bad, I suppose. There is plenty of honey.

That was great! Looks like Phil’s trained another great hero!

Is strength the most important part of a hero?

Well, what you really need is a strong heart. What makes a strong heart? If you have to ask, you’re not a hero yet!

Stop talking in riddles!

It’s not a riddle!

Okay, guys. Prepare for landing.

Land where? In the sea? We’ll drown!

Not with my magic, we won’t. Just leave it to me.

Come on, Sebastian!

Ariel, wait! Slow down! Don’t leave me behind!

Relax, Sebastian. They don’t look like one of them. Right, Flounder?

I don’t know. There’s something weird about them.

What do you mean?

They do seem... a little different. Where are you from?

We’re from kind of far away. And we’re not really used to these waters.

Oh, I see. In that case... Sebastian can show you how we swim around here.

Ariel, King Triton will not like this!

Oh, don’t worry.

Easy for you to say... Okay, it’s time you learn how to swim properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All right. Begin.

Good job. Now let’s move onto self-defense.

Sebastian!

Class is over. Good luck!

Those creatures chased us here.

Oh, no! Those monsters might be heading for the palace, too!

We’d better head back right away!

But, wh-what if we run into more on our way back?

I’m sorry, but we need your help. Please come to the palace with us. The trident markers on the walls point the way there. We won’t get lost as long as we follow them. Okay, let’s get going.

That was too close. As long as I have my trident, I will not tolerate those creatures inside this palace.

Daddy!

Oh, Ariel! When will you listen? It’s dangerous out there!

Strange creatures lurk outside.

Behold. You swim before the ruler of the seas: His Majesty, King Triton.

And who are they?

They helped us fight off those creatures.

They don’t look familiar.

We’re from an ocean very far away.

Yup. We came to find the Keyhole.

The what?

What’s that?

A-hyuck! Well, it’s a—

There’s no such thing! Certainly not here!

But, Daddy...

Ariel, not another word! You are not to leave the palace. Is that clear?

Perhaps I’m being too strict... I’m just concerned for her safety.

Of course, Your Majesty. But I must admit, now I’m quite curious about this Keyhole.

That need not concern you, Sebastian. Have you anything to report?

Just as you suspected, Your Majesty, they seem to be coming from Ursula’s grotto.

I knew it. That sea witch is up to no good again.

I see exile from the palace has taught her nothing.

Yes, she poses serious danger.

And I told you to keep Ariel away from such danger, did I not?

Your Majesty, please, I, uh...

Come to my grotto. I want to show you something.

There it is. See?

Look at all the wonderful things Flounder and I’ve collected. I think it’s all from the outside world.

Someday, I’m going to see what’s out there. I want to see other worlds. Does that sound strange?

No. Not at all. I used to feel the same way.

Used to?

I mean...I still do.

Hey, why don’t we try looking for that Keyhole you were talking about?

But your father said—

Oh, he treats me like a little girl. He never wants to let me do anything. He just... He just doesn’t understand.

There’s this really big fish who can swim against the current. But he’s scared of those weird things swimming around. So if we chase them away, I think the big fish’ll play with us. Maybe if you grab onto him, he’ll take you somewhere.

Those impudent fools will never find the Keyhole.

But the girl could prove useful. And I’ve got the Heartless on my side.

Triton, my old friend... Your day is coming.

Hm. Its shape reminds me of something...

Ariel, you’ve disobeyed me again!

I told you not to leave the palace!

Daddy, no!

How could you...

Young man, you’re not from another ocean. You’re from another world. Aren’t you?

Huh?

Then you must be the key bearer.

How did you know?

You may fool Ariel, but you can’t fool me. You don’t know your dorsal fin from your tail.

Aw...

As the key bearer, you must already know... One must not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.

Of course I know that, but...

You have violated this principle. The key bearer shatters peace and brings ruin.

Aw, Sora’s not like that.

I thank you for saving my daughter. But there is no room in my ocean for you or your key.

My, my, the poor child suffers such deep sorrow.

What a pity. If only there were something we could do...

Wait. Maybe she can be of some help.

Yes. Maybe she can be of some help to you.

Who’re you talking about?

Oh, she would surely help you.

She’d make all your dreams come true.

Ursula can help...

You called, my dear?

You’re Ursula? I was just wondering if—

It’s all right. Helping others is what I live for. Let me guess. You wish to see other worlds. That shouldn’t be too hard. After all, your new friends came from another world.

What?

But they had special help—that mysterious key.

Now, now. Cheer up, sweetie. You have something special, too.

Now listen carefully. I think the Keyhole they seek is somewhere in the palace.

Now, my dear, if you can take me there without your daddy knowing...

I can help you get to these other worlds you long for.

The trident is mine at last! And I couldn’t have done it without your help, my dear.

Ursula, no! I didn’t want this!

Why not? Aren’t you tired of following your dear daddy’s orders?

Oh, yes. We had a deal, didn’t we? Time for a little journey—to the dark world of the Heartless!

We cannot find the Keyhole.

The Keyhole is not here.

What?

Why, we have company. I’m afraid you’re a little late, handsome!

Daddy!

The trident... We must get it back.

Come on, let’s go!

Wait, I’m going with you! My father is hurt and it’s all my fault. I have to stop Ursula!

That’s right. I’m right behind you, Ariel.

Ursula draws power from her cauldron. To defeat Ursula, you must strike her cauldron with magic.

What is that thing?

Need some help? I’ll show you how it’s done.

Come out! You can’t run!

Your time has come!

Sea and wind, hear my command!

Get up and fight!

No... Impossible!

You’ll pay for this!

Let’s go. We must get the trident back.

You pathetic fools! I rule the seas now!

The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!

Hey, you. Not so fast! Get ready for this!

Hmph... Slippery little morsel.

You dare to strike me!

This won’t be pretty!

Daddy, I’m so sorry.

Please don’t be angry with her.

It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I wouldn’t let you follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost my temper and destroyed it.

Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?

The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The Keyhole is dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.

Daddy...

Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole. My trident also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?

Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the start.

Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?

You should know better than anyone. It’s in your grotto.

Really... Sora, let’s go.

Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?

Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.

It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to other worlds, maybe I can, too.

So many places I want to see... I know I’ll get there someday. I’ll find a way somehow. I’m sure of it.

Well, if you find it, do me a favor and leave me out of it.

This is from my collection. I want you to have it.

I think my magic is as good as Donald’s now.

No way! Not in a million years.

Why don’t you go see Merlin? Work more on your magic.

You’re making excellent progress. Here’s something for your effort.

Keep it up.

Look, Pooh. Something is floating this way.

I think you’re right, Piglet. What could it be?

Why, it looks like Eeyore! Hello, Eeyore, if it is you.

Hello, Pooh. Yes, it’s me. Could you pull me out? That is, if it’s not too much trouble. Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to.

Thank you, Pooh. Thank you, other you. You know, floating along out there, it seemed like something was missing...

And something’s still missing.

Why, Eeyore’s tail is gone! Is that what’s missing?

Let’s see... Yep, lost it again. Wonder where it went this time. It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I don’t know why anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...

Sora, why don’t we all look for Eeyore’s tail?

Lost something?

Searching from a high place is the quickest way to find it!

Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s tail?

Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much reading, you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.

You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit nicely. I’ll tell you more when you get there.

Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.

How?

Like this.

Like this?

How’s this?

Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it right, Pooh will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t go any higher. Push too late, he’ll go too high.

Hm? That looks familiar...

How’s it looking?

There we go.

It’s not much of a tail, but it’s mine. Thanks, everyone.

I wish we could put the Hundred Acre Wood back the way it was, too!

Brrr! I think I spend too much time on the swing.

Thank you, Sora. This is nice and warm. You’ve helped us so much. This is just something to say thank you.

This sure is a spooky place. I’ll bet the people here are scary- lookin’ too.

Don’t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we’ll scare them right back!

You think so?

And now, allow me to introduce...

The master of terror... the king of nightmares—Jack Skellington!

Bravo, Jack! Bravo! Those ghosts will be a big hit at this year’s Halloween!

Thank you, thank you! But their movement still needs work. It’s not scary enough.

I want to strike bone-chilling terror.

I’m going to consult the doctor.

Then I’ll go attend to the decorations.

I don’t understand. Maybe the guidance system was damaged in the explosion.

Nonsense. My devices are always perfect!

Oh, I’ve got it! Why, of course! The Heartless need a heart! Doctor, do you think we can add a heart to that device?

Certainly. A heart’s not all that complicated.

Let’s get to work.

To make a heart, first take a container with a lock...

We need the key to this thing first!

You’re really gonna unlock it for them?

Why not? If they succeed, we won’t have to fight the Heartless, right? Besides, I want to see the Heartless dance, too. Don’t you?

Not really.

My! That was amazing! Uh, and you are...

Sora.

Well done, Sora! I’d like you to be a part of this year’s Halloween.

What’s this Heartless doing here?

Oh, the Heartless came to town just recently. What’s frustrating is I can’t get them to dance with me. So the doctor and I are trying to improve the guidance system. He’s quite a genius! Okay, Doctor, let’s continue. The ingredients for a heart: Pulse.

Emotion.

Terror.

Fear.

Hope and despair.

Mix them all together, and we have a heart!

It failed!

Maybe we’re missing some ingredients. Let’s try adding memory.

Sally! Sally! Good-for-nothing girl! Don’t know why I bothered creating her!

Sally’s got the memory we need. See if you can track her down.

No problem. Sora, would you like to come along?

Sure.

Jack! Jack! We have a major crisis! The Heartless are completely out of control! We can’t stop them!

Hmm... Maybe our experiment triggered something. Everything will be fine, Mayor. You have nothing to worry about.

Let’s check this place, too, once the Heartless here are out of our way.

Zero! Have you seen Sally anywhere?

Is something wrong, Jack?

No, everything’s going great. We’re going to have the best Halloween ever. All we need now is your memory.


? You mean this?

Jack, I have a bad feeling about this. Why don’t you try something else? There’s still time.

Nothing could beat what I’ve got planned!

Once we give the Heartless a heart, they’ll dance just as I envision it.

Trust me. You’re going to love it!

I have a bad feeling about this. If only Jack would reconsider... I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him. I’m worried about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these kids star in the festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And funny, too. They’d be better than the Heartless.

Lock!

Shock!

Barrel!

Did you hear that?

Yeah, I sure did! A heart! What should we do?

Gosh, you really are stupid! Isn’t it obvious?

Tell Oogie Boogie.

Yes. This is it. Now, just one more ingredient. We need
to complete the heart. The mayor should know where it is.

A heart? That bonehead Jack is really making a heart? I’ll be jiggered! That works for me!

Ohh, when I get my hands on that...

Well, I’ve got no hands, but I’m still gonna nab that heart and control the Heartless.

Ghost rise from those tombstones. Check the tombstones in the order the ghosts appear. If you get it wrong, you’re in for a surprise!

Splendid! Now go look at the pumpkin.

Yes. This is it.

There you go. This time it’s sure to work.

Ya!

The nerve of those little hooligans, stealing my work!

We lost them!

Zero, after them, quick!

I knew Oogie Boogie was behind this!

We were just following orders! Oogie Boogie told us to steal the heart. It’s all Barrels fault! It was his idea to tell Oogie Boogie about the heart.

Yeah, that’s right!

B-But you guys said—

You should be ashamed!

Oogie Boogie made us do it. We had no choice.

Oogie Boogie told us not to give away his hiding place. Oh, and we’re not supposed to talk about the lever, either.

What’s he going to do with the heart? Beats me. I’d stay away from Oogie Boogie if I were you.

Hey, I was just following Oogie Boogie’s orders! We don’t have the heart! Oogie Boogie has it!

There’s no way I’m gonna take you to him! If I did that, Oogie Boogie would eat us too.

You’ll never find the green door!

Oogie Boogie, give me back the heart!

You want it? Well, then come on over and get it!

Now, let’s see if I can get their attention. (calling) Oh, Heartless!

This is it?

Nobody disrespects me! Nobody!

C’mon, baby!

Buzzsaw!

Bone Soldiers!

So, that heart was a failure after all.

Huh?

Whoa! How did he get so big?

Look! It’s brimming with the power of darkness! Oogie Boogie is drawing power from those dark globs!

So we just have to destroy those things, right?

Sally, why didn’t I listen to you?

Don’t feel bad, Jack. We’ll come up with another plan for Halloween. Next time, we’ll do it together.

I guess we have no choice. We’ll have to cancel the Heartless Halloween festival for now. Here, I want you to have this.

Visit us any time, Sora. Next year’s Halloween will be the scariest ever!

Emotion, memory... We put in all the necessary ingredients. What else do you need to make a heart? What is a heart, anyway? I can’t figure it out.

Uh, a big ship is catching up to us.

Quit gawking! That’s a pirate ship!

It’s going to ram us! Hold tight!

I didn’t think you’d come, Sora.

Good to see you again.

Where are Donald and Goofy?

Are they that important to you? More important than old friends? Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking...

...about her.

Kairi!

That’s right. While you were off goofing around, I finally found her. (Sora starts to run towards them, when a hook blocks his path)

Not so fast. No shenanigans aboard my vessel, boy.

Riku, why are you siding with the Heartless?

The Heartless obey me now, Sora. Now I have nothing to fear.

You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart.

Not a chance. My heart’s too strong.

Riku...

I’ve picked up a few other tricks as well. Like this, for instance.

You can go see your friends now.

Let’s get under way, already. And keep Sora away from Kairi until we’re ready to land.

That scurvy brat thinks he can order me around!

What shall we do, Captain Hook?

Nothing! The hold is crawling with Heartless.

Let them keep an eye on the brats.

But, Captain, you-know-who is also down—

Shh... Did you hear that, Smee? Oh, that dreadful sound!

No, Captain.

Are you quite sure? Did I imagine it? Oh, my poor nerves...

You don’t say?

Yeah, it was definitely Kairi. I’ve finally found her.

All right! A-hyuck! Then let’s go up and talk to her.

Yeah!

Sounds great. Okay, but first...how about getting off!

Oh, sorry.

Ahem!

How ya doin’ there? Looking for a way out?

Who are you?

I’m the answer to your prayers.

Okay, then. Fine. Have it your way.

But you’re stuck in here too, aren’t you?

No. I’m just waiting for someone.

Who?

Tinker Bell, what took you so long?

Great job. So you found Wendy?

Hold on. There was another girl there, too?

Are you crazy? There’s no way I’m gonna leave Wendy there!

Aha. She must be pretty jealous.

Come on, Tink! Open up the door!

Ahem!

I’m Peter Pan.

I’m Sora.

Okay, we’re in this together, but only ‘til we find Wendy.

So, uh, how come you can fly?

Anyone can fly. You wanna try?

Aw, haven’t you cooled off yet, Tink?

Just a little bit of pixie dust. There. Now you can fly.

What? So Wendy’s not one of the chosen ones?

There are seven, supposedly, and Maleficent says she’s not one of them.

Hoist anchor as soon as possible. Leave all the dead weight behind, including her.

After the trouble of capturing her? And why those seven? What is Maleficent planning, anyway?

Who knows? As long as it means getting Kairi’s heart back, I couldn’t care less.

You’re wasting your time! The Heartless has devoured that girl’s heart. I’ll stake me other hand it’s lost forever.

I will find it no matter what.

Uh, Captain...

What?

The prisoners have escaped. What’s more, Peter Pan is with them.

Blast that Peter Pan! All right, then! Bring the hostage to me cabin, Smee! Hop to it!

What is it, Tink?

Peter? Peter Pan?

Wendy!

Please hurry! The pirates are coming!

What! I’ll be right up there! Just hold on!

Wendy?

Yes?

Is there another girl in there with you?

Oh, why, yes. But she seems to be asleep. She hasn’t budged an inch.

Kairi? Kairi!

Wendy! Hey, let’s get up there!

Wendy, are you in there?

Riku, wait!

Wendy!

Come on, Tink! Not now!

Well, this is as far as I can go. I’ve gotta help Wendy.

Quite a codfish, that Riku—running off with that girl without even saying goodbye.

Run off where? Tell me, where did he go?

To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent resides. But you won’t be going there.

Unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend behind?

Hand over the Keyblade and I’ll spare your lives. Be glad I’m merciful, unlike the Heartless. So, which will it be? The Keyblade, or the plank?

It’s him! The crocodile that took me hand! Oh, Smee! He’s after me other hand! I can’t stay here!

Go away! Oh, I can’t stand the sight of him!

Smee, you take care of them!

Fly, Sora! Just believe, and you can do it!

Thanks, Peter.

Hey, don’t mention it. You didn’t think I’d leave you and Tink behind, did you?

You’re all going down!

Toodle-oo!

Is that you, Smee? Did you finish them off?

Aye, Captain. They walked the plank, every last one of them.

P-Peter Pa—blast you!

Ready to make a splash, you codfish? Now it’s your turn to talk the plank!

Fire!

Come and get me!

Uh, Kairi couldn’t wake up, so maybe she’s really lost her—

Shh!

Sora.

I still can’t believe it.

I really flew. Wait ‘til I tell Kairi. I wonder if she’ll believe me. Probably not.

You can bring her to Never Land sometime. Then she can try it herself.

If you believe, you can do anything, right? I’ll find Kairi. I know I will. There’s so much I want to tell her—about flying, the pirates, and everything else that’s happened.

What’s that, Tink? What about the clock tower? You say there’s something there?

Hey, Sora.

Hm?

When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!

Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!

It was reckless to bring her here without at least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark powers could cost you your heart.

A castaway.

Though his world perished, his heart did not. When we took the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here through sheer force of will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is no match for your power.

My power?

Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now, child, it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true potential.

Peter, are you really going back to Never Land?

Afraid so. But we can see each other any time. As long as you don’t forget about Never Land, that is.

Oh, boy. She’s getting’ steamed again. Do me a favor. Look after her for me, will ya?

What?

Peter remains with me as long as I remember him. You will find Kairi if she remains in your heart. You’ll find her Sora. Just don’t give up.

Well, we found the Navi-Gummi piece. Let’s go back to town.

Cid’ll install it on the ship once we bring it to him.

Pinocchio?

Hey, it’s Sora!

Well, hello, Sora!

How did you get here?

A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this house to live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I hear you three are fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be able to help you, so I made this.

For us?

But of course! Pinocchio and I can’t thank you enough! We’ll do anything we can to help you.

I’m being good, even without Jiminy’s help.

Looks like you found the other one. Let me see it.

Okay, wait here. I’ll get it installed right now.

Sora!

Now, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad faces.

How can you be so cheerful? There’s still no sign of your king. Aren’t you worried?

Aw, phooey.

The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and we found you. So as long as we stick together, it’ll all work out okay. Ya just gotta believe in yourself, that’s all.

Just believe...

I believe in you.

Where am I?

Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the warmth of light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over it. They wanted to keep it for themselves. And darkness was born in their hearts. The darkness spread, swallowing the light and many people’s hearts. It covered everything, and the world disappeared. But small fragments of light survived...in the hearts of children. With these fragments of light, children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in now. But the true light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the worlds are still scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a door to the innermost darkness will open. And the true light will return. So, listen, child. Even in the deepest darkness, there will always be a light to guide you. Believe in the light, and the darkness will never defeat you. Your heart will shine with its power and push the darkness away. Do you understand, Kairi?

Kairi!?

Huh?

What’s the matter?

Um, nothing. Kairi... Did you call me?

I installed that navigation gummi. But, ya know? That place is crawling with Heartless. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.

Here, take this along.

Show me what you’ve got!

Hercules, wait. Let’s go one-on-one!

Oh, brother. What a show-off.

What’re we gonna do?

Let him go alone, I guess.

Good luck, Sora!

I’m not gonna go easy on you!

Wow! And I didn’t even hold back!

Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Mine comes from Donald and Goofy.

Come again?

If we stick together, we’re unbeatable. Not even Hercules stands a chance.

With these guys beside me, I’m ready for anything!

But that’s not exactly what I—

Of course. Your friends give you strength. Isn’t that right, Phil? The three of you together make great heroes.

And as a team, I’m sure you can overcome anything.

Phil wasn’t happy that I lost to you. Said I was getting soft. You beat me last time, but next time won’t be so easy.

Gawrsh, look at that!

I know this place...

Hmm, that’s strange.

I wonder why... I feel this warmth inside, right here.

Aw, you’re just hungry.

Hey, I’m serious!

Let’s go!

No vessel, no help from the Heartless... So tell me, how’d you get here?

I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world fell into darkness, Belle was taken from me. I vowed I would find her again no matter what the cost. I believed I would find her. So, here I am. She must be here. I will have her back!

Take her, if you can!

Stop!

So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting for you. We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as I’ve always pushed you.

Riku...

But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade masters.

What are you talking about?

Let the Keyblade choose...

...its true master.

Huh?

What!?

Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to save Kairi.

It’s up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door...

...and change the world.

But that’s impossible. How did this happen? I’m the one who fought my way here with the Keyblade!

You were just the delivery boy.

Sorry, your part’s over now. Here, go play hero with this.

Goofy. Let’s go. We have to remember our mission.

Oh! Well, I know the king told us to follow the key and all... But...

Sora, Sorry.

Hey, don’t move. You’re hurt.

Why... Why did you...you come here? I came to fight for Belle.

And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave without her. That’s why I’m here.

Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find someone very important to me.

O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!

Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you ready for them?

Belle?

Quit while you can.

No. Not without Kairi.

The darkness will destroy you.

You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body, but it can’t touch my heart.

My heart will stay with my friends. It’ll never die!

Really... Well, we’ll just see about that!

Sora ain’t gonna go anywhere!

You’d betray your king?

Not on your life! But I’m not gonna betray Sora, either, ‘cause he’s become one of my best buddies after all we’ve been through together!

See ya later, Donald. Could ya tell the king I’m really sorry?

Hold on, Goofy! We’ll tell him together.

Well, you know... All for one and one for all.

I guess you’re stuck with us, Sora.

Thanks a lot... Donald, Goofy.

How will you fight without a weapon?

I know now I don’t need the Keyblade. I’ve got a better weapon. My heart.

Your heart? What good will that weak little thing do for you?

All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grown with each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made. I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part of mine. And if they think of me now and then...if they don’t forget me...then our hearts will be one.

I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!

No... Not yet...

So, your heart won this battle.

Why? It was mine.

Know this.

The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade.

What? You’re saying my heart’s weaker than his?

For that instant, it was.

However, you can become stronger.

You showed no fear in stepping through the door to darkness. It held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and your heart will grow even stronger.

What should I do?

It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the darkness. That is all. Let your heart, your being become darkness itself.

So, I see the path has emerged at last.

Yes. The Keyhole to the darkness.

Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.

What do I care? The darkness holds no power over me. Rather, I will use its power to rule all worlds.

Such confidence.

Oh!

Impossible! The princesses of heart are all here! It must be her.

Without her heart, she will never be able to release her power.

The king’s fools are here. I’ll deal with them myself.

You stay here and guard the princesses.

I’m afraid you’re too late. Any moment now, the final Keyhole will be unsealed. This world will be plunged into darkness. It is unstoppable.

We’ll stop it! After coming this far, there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen!

You poor, simple fools. You think you can defeat me? Me, the mistress of all evil?

Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of lightning to strike them down!

No!

Meteors of heaven, unleash thy fury!

Give me strength!

Come out!

Away!

No!

Do you need some help?

Riku!

Is that—

Yes. A Keyblade.

But unlike yours, this Keyblade holds the power to unlock people’s hearts. Allow me to demonstrate... Behold!

Wha—

Now, open your heart, surrender it to the darkness! Become darkness itself!

This is it! This power!

Darkness... The true darkness!

Step aside!

How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.

What?

The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning. She failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A fitting end for such a fool.

Kairi!

Kairi! Kairi! Open your eyes!

It’s no use.

That girl has lost her heart. She cannot wake up.

What? You... You’re not Riku.

The Keyhole cannot be completed so long as the last princess of heart still sleeps.

The princess...? Kairi’s a princess?

Yes, and without her power, the Keyhole will remain incomplete. It is time she awakened.

Whoever you are, let Riku go! Give him back his heart!

But first, you must give the princess back her heart.

Sora!

What’s—

Don’t you see yet?

The princess’s heart is responding. It has been there all along. Kairi’s heart rests within you!

Kairi... Kairi’s inside me?

I know all that there is to know.

Tell me. Who are you?

It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.

So, I shall release you now, Princess. Complete the Keyhole with your power. Open the door, lead me into everlasting darkness!

Sora!

Forget it! There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart!

Come!

Now witness true power!

Behold the power of darkness!

Riku!

Sora! Sora, look!

The... The Keyhole!

It won’t work! The Keyhole’s not finished yet!

What can we do?

Maybe we’ve gotta go wake Kairi up.

I think you’re right.

If we can free her heart... But... But how?

A Keyblade that unlocks people’s hearts... I wonder.

Sora?

Sora, hold on!

No, wait!

Sora... Sora!

Sora!

Sora! Come back, Sora!

What’s... What’s happening to me? Falling...falling...into darkness.

Sora, are you really—No. He can’t be! I won’t let him go!

So, you have awakened at last, Princess. The Keyhole is now complete. You have served your purpose. But now it’s over.

Don’t make another move!

Do you think we can stop him all by ourselves?

I don’t know!

Impossible...

No. You won’t use me for this!

Riku!

You’ve got to run! The Heartless are coming!

What about the Keyhole?

Let’s just get out of here!

Kairi, hurry!

I can’t leave them behind!

We can’t stay here!

I’ll take care of him!

Confounded Heartless! Get lost, will ya?

Sora? Is that you?

Uh-oh!

This time, I’ll protect you.

Sora!

Kairi!

Kairi, thank you.

Sora...

Sora!

Go! Now!

Come with us!

I told you before, I’m not leaving without Belle. Now, go! The Heartless are coming!

All right. Let’s get out of here.

Tell me what happened.

So the darkness is flowing out of that Keyhole...

No wonder there are more and more Heartless everywhere. The only way to stop them is—

Seal the Keyhole, right?

Maybe. But no one knows what will happen once it’s sealed.

Well, we can’t just stay here. We have to do something. I’ve got a friend back there.

That’s right. You have one more friend to worry about. Riku’s Keyblade must have been born of the captive princesses’ hearts—just like that Keyhole you saw.

Of course, without Kairi’s heart, it remained incomplete. Once that Keyblade was destroyed, the princesses’ hearts should have been freed. Don’t worry, Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you can.

Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger. New types of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything happens to us, I know we can count on you, Sora.

Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.

I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I mean the darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is holding the darkness back.

It seems the other princesses have been freed as well. Jasmine apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are still in the castle, too.

Do you remember seeing a man with spiky hair at the coliseum?

Yup.

I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora. If you see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but we all care about him dearly.

Cid, I need to go back to Hollow Bastion.

I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless there are multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.

Then what can we do?

Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new navigation gummi and take a new route.

A new gummi? From where?

The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I stored it there in case I ever needed it. Never thought a kid would be the one to use it!

What a mysterious mural... It’s almost hypnotizing.

Let’s go back and join the others. We should rest up

Okay.

A light at the end of the tunnel...

Oh, your grandma’s story, right?

That’s right. We were together.

You know what’s funny? I looked everywhere for you, but you were with me all along. Finally, we’re together, Kairi.

Now, it’s time to get Riku back.

You think it’ll ever be the same again between us? Riku’s lost his...

When I turned into a Heartless, you saved me, remember?

I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I stumbled through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I was. The darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice. You brought me back.

I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I couldn’t.

That’s it! Our hearts are connected.

And the light from our hearts broke through the darkness. I saw that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep the darkness, a light shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy tale.

Well, let’s go.

You can’t go.

Why not?

Because it’s way too dangerous.

Come on, Sora. We made it this far by sticking together. You can’t go alone.

Kairi, even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Right?

I can’t help?

You’d kind of be in my way.

Okay. You win.

Take this.

It’s my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.

Don’t worry. I will.

Promise?

Promise.

Don’t ever forget. Wherever you go, I’m always with you.

Sora... Kairi... I’m sorry...

Is this the afterworld?

I’m not ready. Not yet. Not until I see Sora and Kairi one last time...

Riku, can you hear me? I’ll be there soon.

Who is that?

I have the other Keyblade—the one that belongs to this world.

I’ve been trying to get through to you, but the darkness in your heart kept me away.

Who are you? What’s happened to me?

Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it was too late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness where hearts are gathered.

So what do I do?

The Door of Darkness will open soon, but it’s a door we can’t enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two keys and two hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe it was fate.

Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you? Then tell me: Are Sora and Kairi okay?

Don’t you feel the echoes of their hearts? You already know the answer. Look inside your own heart.

Okay.

You found it? All right, I’ll go fix up your ship.

This here is my bouncin’ spot! We can bounce around here all day!

Nothing beats bouncin’!

You wanna bounce, too, Sora? It’s lotsa fun!

Okay!

To bounce with the finest, you’ll need some pointers from the finest.

But, Owl, you don’t bounce around like we do!

I’m afraid you’re right. I can’t master everything, I suppose.

Bounce this way, please!

Here’s a little warm-up.

Now it gets tricky!

You’re doin’ fantastical! This’ll be the last one.

You’ve gotten mighty good at bouncin’, Sora! Right, Roo?

Hey, Tigger! I think he’s ready for the big one!

Well, there’s only one way to find out!

This tree doesn’t have honey, I see.

I wonder what this is.

Rare nuts grow on these trees. I’ll trade you things for them.

Look at all these nuts! We couldn’t have done it without you. What are they for? It’s a secret.

Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!

Thank you, Sora. Here’s something for you.

Take good care of them.

All set! You can get going any time. Kid, I gotta say, I wish you didn’t have to face all this danger. Don’t get cocky just ‘cause you’ve been there before. That castle’s probably crawling with ‘em now...

There’s a new warp hole near Traverse Town.

I wonder where it leads... Hmm. Some weird power is emanating from the worlds.

Might be worth revisiting some places again.

Yo, hey, how’re you doin’ everybody, yeah. Got a minute? Hades, Lord of the Dead. Nice to see you. Hey, guess what? I got a place for you down under!

Feel the heat...

That all you’ve got?

That’s it!

Oh! Hey, kid, wh-what are you doing?

Stop! Hey, guys! G-Get away from me! Come on! Come on!

Sora!

Sora!

Where’s Belle?

Still in the castle.

Against her will?

No, I think she stayed for a reason. The other princesses are inside as well.

I wonder why?

Let’s go ask them.

You may need my strength. I’ll go with you.

Belle!

You’ve come to seal the Keyhole, right? Please, be careful. The darkness is raging deep inside. We’ve been holding it back, but we can’t hold out much longer.

We’ll take care of it.

This is for you. Use it to face the darkness, as the Beast has.

So many books, but not one on how to banish the darkness. Maybe it’s hopeless...

We’ve been waiting for you, Keyblade master.

Where’s Ansem?

Gone.

When the Keyhole appeared, darkness poured out of it. It swallowed Ansem, and he disappeared.

Though Ansem is gone, the flood of darkness hasn’t stopped. We’re working together to hold it back.

I cannot forget the look on his face. As the darkness engulfed him, he was smiling.

Sora, please hurry! Darkness is pouring from the Keyhole.

It’s all we can do just to hold back the darkness.

I don’t even know how long we can manage even that.

All right, I’m on my way.

We’re counting on you, Keyblade master. In the meantime, we’ll do what we can, too.

Ansem has ignored us since the Keyhole appeared.

I don’t think Ansem will ever return.

We must close the Keyhole before it’s too late.

Can you feel the immense power flowing from that Keyhole?

Please hurry. Our strength is running out.

Now let’s go and seal that big Keyhole!

Sora. You did it.

What are you guys doing here?

We came in Cid’s ship.

This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it again.

It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so peaceful...

Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be restored. Including your island.

Really?

But, it also means goodbye.

Once the worlds are restored, they’ll all be separate again.

Everyone will go back to where they came from.

Then I’ll visit you guys with the gummi ship.

It’s not that simple.

Before all this, you didn’t know about the other worlds, right?

Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls divided them.

The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds return, so will the walls.

Which means gummi ships will be useless.

So you’re saying we’ll never...?

We may never meet again, but we’ll never forget each other.

No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.

Besides, I couldn’t forget you even if I wanted to.

What’s that supposed to mean?

Sora!

Hurry! Come and close the Keyhole!

Sora, good luck.

Thank you, Sora. I think the darkness has begun to weaken.

But I can feel a powerful darkness growing somewhere far away.

It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem went.

Then we’ll take the gummi ship and deal with both Ansem and the Heartless.

A worthy answer, Keyblade master. We offer this power to aid your battle.

Sora, your courage can bring back our worlds.

Once the darkness is gone, all should return to its original state.

Kairi will be back on the island?

Most certainly. And you should be, too.

I can’t go home ‘til I find Riku and the king.

I still can’t believe we played a part in opening the Keyhole. To think we had such a power... Simply unimaginable! My world is gone, so I suppose I must stay here for the time being.

The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well. Otherwise, this world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You helped me during that silly trial. Now it’s my turn to help you.

Maleficent used to live in our world. She used her great powers to control the darkness... But eventually it came to control her. I’m so glad the others are here with me.

The darkness took my home. I don’t know where to go now. I hope my loved ones are safe somewhere. I’ll do whatever I can to keep this world from being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was before.

Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will worry to death if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to Agrabah. I hope everything is all right in Agrabah.

Sora, you should read this.

Read what?

It’s the rest of Ansem’s report. Maleficent must have collected it.

Ansem disappeared when this world fell to the darkness. It was believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But Ansem was the one who brought them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s a little light to protect you, Sora.

Read that report and you’ll understand Ansem’s intentions. I believe the worlds can be restored. They are still alive.

Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness. You know, I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?

This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as a wise man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s hearts. Heh, some wise man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?

This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I don’t remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.

We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just another puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real enemy. But how to beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last Heartless we can find.

There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta get rid of the Heartless and rebuild this world.

I won’t use my real name until this world is restored.

Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source of all power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never extinguish it. Sora, don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade can defeat it.

I’ve been looking for you.

As have I.

As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this nightmare. You’re my darkness.

I’m a part of you, am I? Then join me in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.

Could the appearance of that gate be a bad omen?

There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.

What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness... Be careful, Sora!

I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s not darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous than darkness.

We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But this is different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from both the light and the darkness.

Who are you?

Ah, it seems you are special, too.

Ansem?

That name rings familiar.

You remind me of him.

What’s that supposed to mean?

It means you are not whole.

You are incomplete. Allow me—to test your strength.

Impressive.

This will be enjoyable.

What are you talking about?

It is beyond your comprehension, for now.

Until we meet again.

Wait, what are you—

I am—

...but a mere shell.

What are you doing, Pooh?

Shh. Quiet, or they’ll get away!

Who?

The people who took everyone away. See their footprints? We were all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then, I saw some footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone was gone. Bad people must have taken them away!

Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um... Anyway, I’ll help you look for your friends.

Eeyore?

Hello.

What are you doing?

Lookin’ for sticks to build my house...again.

Sticks for your house?

This place already feels like a house... Seems like a great spot to gather everyone once we find them.

I saw Pooh walkin’ away, so I bounced after him! Then I bounced a bit too high, and I lost sight of ol’ Pooh Bear!

I tried bouncin’ as high as Tigger. I was so busy tryin’ to bounce, I forgot to watch where I was bouncin’!

Hello, Piglet. So this is where you’ve been. Maybe I should bring Pooh along.

I thought I’d better have a word with Roo about his bouncing. The next thing I knew, quite to my surprise, I was lost, too!

Owl looked so intent on something, well, I just had to follow him! But then Owl flew off into the sky, and there I was, all by myself.

Hello, Piglet.

Pooh! Where are we?

I don’t know where we are either, Piglet. But if we go back the way we came, we should find home.

I got scared when everyone disappeared, so I hid.

Everyone’s here!

I’m so glad we’re all together again.

I didn’t know what to do when I was all alone.

Aw, Piglet, you gotta be brave.

You weren’t lonely at all?

Lonely? Are you kiddin’? I’m a Tigger! The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I’m the only one. But I do admit, friends are awfully fun, too!

Think, think, think.

Hey, Pooh, what are you thinking about now?

Oh, well, I’m just thinking about what to think about.

Well, I’m off.

Sora, where are you going?

I’m gonna go look for my friends. They’re waiting for me.

Bounce on back again!

I hope you find your friends!

Sora, don’t forget... We shall always be here.

If you’d like to visit again, that is.

You’ve been a great help, Sora. Thank you! You helped Pooh get honey from the bees. You helped protect Rabbit’s carrots. You helped find Eeyore’s lost tail. You bounced along with Tigger and Roo. And you found all of us when we were lost. We can’t thank you enough. This is from all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.

Gawrsh, is that all that’s left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?

Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right?

You betcha.

But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and disconnected, what’s gonna happen to this place? And to us?

Well, uh...

This is a Heartless world, so maybe it’ll just disappear.

Huh?!

But no worries. Even if this place goes poof, our hearts ain’t goin’ nowhere. I’m sure we’ll find our pals again. Yup, I just know that we will.

Yeah, you’re right.

I’ll return this. I promise.

I wonder where that Ansem feller went?

Dive into the most dangerous place and we’ll find him!

Huh?

What’s wrong?

Don’t you hear something? There!

Careful. This is the last haven you’ll find here. Beyond, there is no light to protect you. But don’t be afraid. Your heart is the mightiest weapon of all. Remember, you are the one who will open the door to the light.

I don’t hear anything.

Strange... That voice was so familiar. Maybe it’s just my imagination.

Maybe you’d better take a rest!

Is this... Is this my island?

This world has been connected.

What was that?

Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.

There is so very much to learn.

You understand so little.

A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.

Take a look at this tiny place. To the heart seeking freedom this is a prison surrounded by water. And so this boy sought out to escape from his prison.

He sought a way to cross over into other worlds. And he opened his heart to darkness.

Riku!

Don’t bother. Your voice can no longer reach him where he is. His heart belongs again to darkness. All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different.

Darkness sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it. Such is its nature. In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came.

You see, darkness is the heart’s true essence.

That’s not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even give in. But I’ve learned that deep down, there’s a light that never goes out!

So, you have come this far and still you understand nothing. Every light must fade, every heart return to darkness!

Come, Guardian!

Submit!

Come. Open your heart...

My strength returns.

Wha...?

Behold the endless abyss! Within it lies the heart of all worlds:

Kingdom Hearts! Look as hard as you are able. You’ll not find even the smallest glimmer of light. From those dark depths are all hearts born. Even yours.

Darkness conquers all worlds!

Giving up already? Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger than that.

Turn to darkness!

All shall be extinguished. (Orbs appear around Sora, and before he has a chance to duck, he is hit by a cluster of lasers. Sora flies downward away from them, but also away from Ansem)

Come forth.

Sora!

Sora!

Give me strength!

Let me at him!

Come on!

Come...darkness!

Now...you weak-hearted fools...witness real power!

Now show me what your precious light can do.

Still confused? Then perhaps this will enlighten you!

Welcome the darkness into your heart.

Is this the answer? I can’t be...

It is futile. The Keyblade alone cannot seal the door to darkness.

Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness...

Supreme darkness...

You’re wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts... is light!

Light...

But... Why...

Come on!

Stop staring and keep pushing!

Huh?!

The Heartless!?

Hurry!

I can’t...

Don’t give up!

Come on, Sora! Together, we can do it!

Okay!

It’s hopeless!

Huh?

Your Majesty!

Now, Sora! Let’s close this door for good!

Close it, quick!

But...

Don’t worry. There will always be a door to the light.

Sora, you can trust King Mickey.

Now! They’re coming!

Donald, Goofy, thank you.

Take care of her.

Kairi!

Sora!

Kairi, remember what you said before? I’m always with you, too.

I’ll come back to you. I promise!

I know you will!

Well, now what do we do?

We’ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.

But, uh, where do we start lookin’ for that there door to the light?

Pluto?

Hey, Pluto. Where have you been?

Huh?

Hey!

Gawrsh, that’s the king’s seal!

Hey, have you seen King Mickey?

Guys, let’s go!

Remember, Sora. You are the one who will open the door to the light.
