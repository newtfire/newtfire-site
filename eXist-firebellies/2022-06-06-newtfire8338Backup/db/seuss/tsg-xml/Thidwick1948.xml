<title>Thidwick,The Big-Hearted Moose</title>
<body>
<stanza>
<l>
Up at the
<place>
<mUp>LakeWinna-Bango</mUp>
</place>
. . . the far northern
<rym sch="a">shore</rym>
. . .
</l>
<l>
Lives a huge herd of moose, about sixty or
<rym sch="a">more</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
And they all go around in a big happy
<rym sch="b">bunch</rym>
</l>
<l>
Looking for nice tender moosemoss to
<rym sch="b">munch</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Up at the
<place>
<mUp>LakeWinna-Bango</mUp>
</place>
, one day, they were
<rym sch="a">lunching</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
Just strolling along and enjoying their
<rym sch="a">munching</rym>
. . .
</l>
<l>
(For the moose-moss that day was especially
<rym sch="b">fine</rym>
). . .
</l>
<l>
When it happened that
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
, the last moose in
<rym sch="b">line</rym>
,
</l>
<l>Saw a Bingle Bug sitting.</l>
<l>The bug called out, "Hey!</l>
<l>It's such a long road</l>
<l>
And it's such a hot
<rym sch="c">day</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
Would you mind if I rode on your horns for a
<rym sch="c">way</rym>
?"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"Of course not!" smiled
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
, the Big-Hearted Moose.
</l>
<l>
"I'm
<adj>happy</adj>
my
<obj>antlers</obj>
can be of some use.
</l>
<l>
There's room there to spare, and I'm
<adj>happy</adj>
to share!
</l>
<l>
Be my guest and I hope that you're
<adj>comfortable</adj>
there!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
So the Bingle Bug picked out a nice easy
<rym sch="a">seat</rym>
</l>
<l>
And the moose went on looking for
<obj>moose-moss</obj>
to
<rym sch="a">eat</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Well. . . An hour or so later</l>
<l>
The bug heard a
<sound>squeak</sound>
,
</l>
<l>
And he heard the
<adj>small</adj>
voice.
</l>
<l>Of a Tree Spider speak.</l>
<l>"I say!" said the spider,</l>
<l>
"You've got a
<adj>nice</adj>
place!
</l>
<l>
That moose seems quite
<adj>friendly</adj>
,
</l>
<l>
Has such a
<adj>nice</adj>
face. . .
</l>
<l>If I got on, too,</l>
<l>Do you think he would mind. . .?"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"Hop aboard!" laughed the bug. "And I think that you'll
<rym sch="a">find</rym>
</l>
<l>That moose won't object.</l>
<l>
He's the
<adj>big</adj>
hearted
<rym sch="a">kind</rym>
!"
</l>
<l>"I accept," said the spider,</l>
<l>
"With
<adj>joy</adj>
and
<rym sch="b">delight</rym>
."
</l>
<l>And he started a web</l>
<l>
On the horn to the
<rym sch="b">right</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
While the spider was spinning, he heard a gay
<rym sch="a">song</rym>
</l>
<l>
And a fresh little
<mUp>Zinn-a-zu bird</mUp>
came
<rym sch="a">along</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
He stopped. And he stared. And he
<sound>chirped</sound>
,
<figOfSp type="repition">
"Well! Well!
<rym sch="b">WELL</rym>
</figOfSp>
!
</l>
<l>
What a smart place to build! What a great place to
<rym sch="b">dwell</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
I've been living on trees ever since I was
<rym sch="c">born</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
But here's something new! Why not live in a
<rym sch="c">horn</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
If there's room there for two, then there's room there for
<rym sch="d">three</rym>
!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"There's plenty of room!"</l>
<l>Laughed the bug. "And it's free!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
stopped walking.
</l>
<l>What was all that talking?</l>
<l>
These guests had caught
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
the Moose unawares.
</l>
<l>"Hey!" he called out. "What goes on there upstairs?"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"Just building a nest,sir."</l>
<l>
The
<mUp>Zinn-a-zu</mUp>
said, and began
<adj>yanking</adj>
hairs out of
<adj>poor</adj>
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
's head.
</l>
<l>And he plucked out exactly two hundred and four!</l>
<l>"Don't worry," he laughed. "you can always grow more!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Then he dozed off to sleep in his fine moose hair
<rym sch="a">nest</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
"This bird," murmured
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
"is sort of a
<rym sch="a">pest</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
But I'm a
<adj>good</adj>
sport, so I'll just let him
<rym sch="b">rest</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
For a host, above all, must be
<adj>nice</adj>
to his
<rym sch="b">guest</rym>
."
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"Besides, now, it's getting quite late in the
<rym sch="a">day</rym>
</l>
<l>
And surely tomorrow they'll all go
<rym sch="a">away</rym>
."
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But, alas! The next morning</l>
<l>
The suns
<adj>early</adj>
light
</l>
<l>
Brought to
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
's sad eyes
</l>
<l>A most unwelcome sight. . .</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"Meet my wife!" said the bird.</l>
<l>"I was married last night.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"And, perhaps by the way,</l>
<l>I should mention to you</l>
<l>That her uncle is coming</l>
<l>To live with us, too.</l>
<l>You're a very fine host so I</l>
<l>Knew you'd be willing. . ."</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then the uncle, a woodpecker, started in drilling!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
All
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
's friends shouted, "GET RID OF THOSE PESTS!"
</l>
<l>
"I would, but I can't." sobbed
<adj>poor</adj>
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
. "They're guests!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"Guests indeed!" his friends answered and all of them frowned.</l>
<l>"If those are your guests, we don't want you around!</l>
<l>You can't stay with us, 'cause you're just not our sort!"</l>
<l>And they all turned their backs and walked off with a snort.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Now the big friendless moose walked alone and
<rym sch="a">forlorn</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
With four great big woodpecker holes in his
<rym sch="a">horn</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"What holes!" whispered Hernan, a squirrel, who spied 'em.</l>
<l>"What holes to hide nuts in! Hmmm! Mind if I tried 'em?"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"They're yours!" called the woodpecker. "Get right inside 'em!</l>
<l>
This
<adj>big</adj>
hearted moose runs a public hotel!
</l>
<l>Bring your nuts! Bring your wife! Bring your children as well!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>So the whole squirrel family all jumped on, pell mell.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And the very next thing the
<adj>poor</adj>
animal knew,
</l>
<l>A Bobcat and turtle were living there, too!</l>
<l>
NOW what was the
<adj>big</adj>
-hearted moose going to do?
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Well what would YOU do</l>
<l>If it happened to YOU?</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
You couldn't say "
<mUp>Skat</mUp>
!" 'cause that wouldn't be right.
</l>
<l>You couldn't shout "Scram!" 'cause that isn't polite.</l>
<l>A host has to put up with all kinds of pests,</l>
<l>
For a host, above all, must be
<adj>nice</adj>
to his guests.
</l>
<l>
So you'd try
<adj>hard</adj>
to smile, and you'd try to look
<adj>sweet</adj>
</l>
<l>
And you'd go right on looking for
<obj>moose-moss</obj>
to eat.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
But now it was winter and that wasn't
<rym sch="a">easy</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
For
<obj>moose-moss</obj>
gets scarce when the weather gets
<rym sch="a">
<adj>freezy</adj>
</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
The food was soon gone on the
<adj>cold</adj>
<place>
northern
<rym sch="b">shore</rym>
</place>
</l>
<l>
Of
<place>
<mUp>Lake Winna-Bango</mUp>
</place>
. There just was no
<rym sch="b">more</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
And all
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
's friends swam away in a
<rym sch="c">bunch</rym>
</l>
<l>
To the south of the lake where there's
<obj>moose-moss</obj>
to
<rym sch="c">munch</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
He watched the herd leaving And then
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
knew
</l>
<l>He'd starve if he stayed here! He'd have to go, too!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
He stepped in the water. Then, oh! What a
<rym sch="a">fuss</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
"STOP!" screamed his guests. "You can't do this to
<rym sch="a">us</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
These horns are our home and you've no right to
<rym sch="b">take</rym>
</l>
<l>
Our home to the
<adj>far</adj>
distant side of the
<rym sch="b">lake</rym>
!"
</l>
<l>
"Be fair!"
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
begged, with a lump in his
<rym sch="c">throat</rym>
. . ..
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"We're fair," said the bug.</l>
<l>"We'll decide this by vote.</l>
<l>All those in favor of going, say AYE,'</l>
<l>All those in favor of staying say NAY'."</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"AYE!" shouted
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
,
</l>
<l>but when he was done. . .</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"NAY!" they all yelled.</l>
<l>He lost 'leven to one.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"We win!" screamed the guests, "by a very
<adj>large</adj>
<rym sch="a">score</rym>
!"
</l>
<l>
And
<adj>poor</adj>
, starving
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
climbed back on the
<rym sch="a">shore</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Then, do you know what those pests
<rym sch="b">did</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
They asked in some
<rym sch="a">more</rym>
!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>They asked in a fox, who jumped in from the trees,</l>
<l>They asked in some mice and they asked in some fleas.</l>
<l>They asked a big bear in and then, if you please,</l>
<l>Came a swarm of three hundred and sixty-two bees!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Poor
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
sank down, with a groan, to his knees.
</l>
<l>
And then, THEN came something that made his heart
<adj>freeze</adj>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Bullets came
<mUp>zinging</mUp>
right past
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
's face!
</l>
<l>Guns were bang-binging all over the place!</l>
<l>"Get that moose!</l>
<l>Get that moose!"</l>
<l>
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
heard a voice
<rym sch="a">call</rym>
.
</l>
<l>"Fire again and again</l>
<l>
And shoot straight one and
<rym sch="a">all</rym>
!

<l>
We must get his head for the Harvard club
<rym sch="a">wall</rym>
!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
<char name="Thidwick">Thidwick</char>
took his heels with that load on his head!
</l>
<l>With five hundred pounds on his horns, the moose fled!</l>
<l>
He could have run
<adj>faster</adj>
without all those pests,
</l>
<l>
But a host, above all, must be
<adj>nice</adj>
to his guests.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Up canyon! Off cliff! Over
<adj>wild</adj>
rocky
<rym sch="a">trail</rym>

<l>
With bullets bang-bouncing around him like
<rym sch="a">hail</rym>

Up gully! Through gulch! And down
<adj>slippery</adj>
<mUp>sluice</mUp>

</l>
<l>
With his
<adj>hard</adj>

<adj>soft</adj>

</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then finally they had him!</l>
<l>
Because of those pests, he had run out of
<rym sch="a">luck</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
Because of those guests on his horns, he was
<rym sch="a">stuck</rym>
!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
He gasped! He felt faint! And the whole world grew

A wonderful something that happens each
