    <h1>Hammer XQuery Exercise</h1>
<!--ebb: Your original code was plotting 5 different tables, one for each draft.That comes out kind of 
difficult to read because the header is repeated over and over. 
Basically, you just want ONE table, and have five rows inside it. 
So, I moved the table element and its top header row up here, so you create just ONE table, not five different ones!
That means you get each row stacked underneath the others and it comes out easier to read, with just one header row
at the top.-->

        <tr>
            <th>Draft</th>
            <th>Title</th>
            <th>Date</th>
            <th>Unique Speaker Count</th>
            <th>Speech Count</th>
