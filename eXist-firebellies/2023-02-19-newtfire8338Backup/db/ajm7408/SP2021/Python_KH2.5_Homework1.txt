A scattered dream that's like a far-off memory. A far-off memory that's like a scattered dream. I want to line the pieces up--yours and mine.

You have arrived. I've been to see him... He looks a lot like you.

Who are you?

I'm what's left. Or... Maybe I'm all there ever was.

I meant your name.

My name is of no importance. What about you? Do you remember your true name?

My true name...is...

Sora.

Whoa!

Give me a break, Kai--!

Giving up already?

If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one?

This world has been connected.

Wh-who's there?

Tied to the darkness...

Sora, don't ever change.

The door has opened...

What?

You understand nothing.

So...ra...

Another dream about him...

Man, doesn't that tick you off?

Yeah, that's just wrong.

Seifer's gone too far this time.

I mean, it's true that stuff's been stolen around town. And we've got a score to settle with Seifer and everything. So if he wants to think we did it, I can't really blame him. See...that's not what really bugs me. What really bugs me is that he's goin' around tellin' everybody we're the thieves! Now the whole town and their mothers are treating us like the Klepto Club! Have you ever been this ticked off before in your life? 'Cause I haven't. Nuh-uh, never. Now...what to do.

Uh...well... We could find the real thieves. That would set the record straight.

Hey that sounds fun!

What about Seifer?

First, we gotta clear our names. Once we find the real culprit, everyone will get off our backs.

Oh no! They're gone!

Our ---- are gone!

What?

All our ------, gone? Huh?

Huh? You can't say -------? Why not?

But you do understand what I'm saying, right? Our ------ are gone!

Stolen... And not just the ------. The word ------! They stole it too!

What kinda thief is that? Seifer could never have pulled that off.

Yeah!

All right, time for some recon!

Huh?

His heart is returning. Doubtless he'll awaken very soon.

Huh?

Roxas, come on.

Over here!

Let's get this investigation underway.

Yo, Roxas. Never thought you'd do such a rotten thing...

We didn't steal anything, all right?

I'd like to believe you, but... Who else would steal that stuff?

What stuff?

As if you didn't know. Hey, I'm not gonna tell you. Go ask at the accessory shop.

Go on, Roxas--- ask her.

Oh, it's you, Roxas... Please don't let me down. You used to be one of my favorite customers.

I'm not a thief!

Okay...

It's no fun having everyone suspecting me, ya know.

Then you've got to find a way to clear your name. The woman at the candy shop is pretty disappointed, too.

Roxas? Have you seen my cat around?

Er...

Thank you, Roxas.

Did they steal something from you, too?

Oh, my, yes. Something important.

Just so you know, we didn't do it.

I believe you.

Thanks for that, ma'am. So what did they take from you?

My ------. My precious ------.

Looks like the culprit is going around stealing ------. And not just ------, but the word ------, too.

This isn't your average thief...

I wonder if Seifer would know anything about this.

We gotta talk to him. C'mon, to the sandlot!

Thieves.

That was low, y'know!

Oh yeah?

Nice comeback there, blondie.

What'd you say!?

You can give us back the ------ now.

Yeah! You're the only ones who would take it, y'know?

That was undeniable proof that we totally owned you lamers. So what did you do? Burn it? Ha, not that we need some ------ to prove that you're losers.

Replay!

Now you're talking!

I guess if you get on your knees and beg, maybe I'll let it slide.

Roxas!

Roxas, focus!

Kneel, loser!

Come on... quit playin' around and fight!

Seifer's not feelin' so hot, y'know!

Tournament decides.

What was that?

The thief!

We have come for you, my liege.

Huh?

It's no use...

What?

What...what is this thing?

What's this?

I was his first customer after he took over the shop. So we took a picture together.

It's a really nice photo. Oh...!

Hey! You just said
!

So, Roxas--tell us about the picture thief.

Not much to say. The pictures were just lying there.

Then how do we prove we weren't the ones who took 'em?

It's a girl...

You look happy, Roxas.

Do not.

So, like, anybody else notice that all the stolen pictures are of Roxas?

Ohh. So that's why everyone thought it was us.

You mean Seifer didn't go around accusing us after all?

Are they really all of me?

Yep.

See?

Look!

Right? Every single one. Wouldn't it be weird if the thief wanted to steal the real Roxas or something?

C'mon, get serious. Why would anyone wanna steal a bonehead like Roxas?

Oh, thanks!

Where...am I?

Who's there?

Who are you?

Restoration at 12%.

Organization miscreants... They've found us.

But...why would the Nobodies steal photographs?

Both are nothing but data to them. The fools could never tell the difference. We are running out of time. Naminé must make haste.

Oh...Where am I?

What happened to my home? My island?

Riku! Kai--!

Who are you?

They will come at you out of nowhere, as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.

Hey, why don't you come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel.

Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.

Donald Duck.

Name's Goofy.

I'm Sora. I'll go with you guys.

The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.

That's right. The Keyblade.

So...this is the key?

But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.

A key...blade?

A Keyblade...

What was that about?

Oh!

Sorry... about that...

Thanks.

Do you guys think we'll always be together like this?

I sure hope so.

Huh? Where did that come from?

Oh, well, you know. Just thinking out loud.

Well, I doubt we can be together forever. But isn't that what growing up's all about? What's important isn't how often we see each other, but how often we think about each other. Right?

Get that off a fortune cookie?

That's it, no more ice cream for you! Man, today's turning out to be a drag.

Maybe because of yesterday's memory thief.

Nuh-uh. You know what it is? We don't want summer vacation to be over. That's all! So, how about this?

We all go to the beach! And why do we go to the beach? Because we haven't gone once this entire vacation! Blue seas! Blue skies! Let's just get on the train and go!

No? Aw, c'mon!

Maybe you forgot, but we're broke.

Maybe you forgot I'm smart!

Hurry up, Roxas!

We're going to Market Street!

Just two days to go. You and I have to make the finals! That way, no matter who wins, the four of us split the prize!

Okay, you're on.

You two are gonna clean up!

Go get 'em!

It's a promise! Now, let's get down to business. One ticket to the beach is 900 munny. How much for four of us?

3600 munny.

And 300 each to spend there. What's that for all of us?

1200 munny. A total of 4800 munny.

To spend on what?

Pretzels, of course! What else is there?

Well, there's always watermelon.

Too pricey. They're, like, 2000 munny apiece.

Pretzels it is.

So, where were we?

We need 4800 munny altogether. But all we have is...

I've got 800.

...650.

150. Sorry.

That's 1600 munny! We need another 3200. Let's find ourselves some odd jobs and earn some dough! We have 'til the train leaves to earn 800 munny each!

Meet at the station with cash in hand!

Didn't he say he had it covered?

Whatever. Those pretzels are sounding pretty good.

All present and accounted for?

What've we got?

Let's see...

Just this.

Good job.

Nice work, everyone. Added to what we started with, we now have...

Tada! 5000 munny!

Sweet!

Let's get tickets!

We can't be together forever... so we'd better make the time we do have something to remember.

Huh?

Gotcha!

Whoa!

Huh?

What?

Roxas! Three minutes!

Okay!

Four students!

Roxas, the money!

Wait--

No!

Huh?

He took it!

Where are you going?

Remember when I fell? I had the money before that. I bet that guy took it!

Guy?

He couldn't have gotten too far...

What are you talking about?

There was no guy.

Huh? But he... There wasn't... Really?

Oh boy...

There wasn't anyone...there?

It's melting.

Sorry.

Cheer up already!

That was definitely weird, though.

Strange.

You said it.

Can you feel Sora?

Can you feel Sora?

Restoration at 28%.

Naminé, hurry.

Is it really that hard to make a beach?

We'd be giving the enemy another entry point.

And this?

We can always buy some sea-salt ice cream.

Objects from that town must be kept out of the real world. You can delete that.

As the key bearer, you must already know one must not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.

So many places I want to see... I know I'll get there someday.

Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes.

Hey! What do you mean
?

You rookies still don't understand what it takes to be a true hero.

I...I wish... ...for your freedom, Genie.

Al!

Sally, why didn't I listen to you?

Don't feel bad, Jack. We'll come up with another plan for Halloween. Next time, we'll do it together.

Power!

I am Mushu.

Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?

Riku! What are you doing here?

Did you find her?

I still can't believe it. I really flew. Wait 'til I tell Kai--.

I wonder if she'll believe me. Probably not.

I'm searching, too.

For your light? Don't lose sight of it.

Sora, where are you going?

I'm gonna go look for my friends. They're waiting for me.

Where are Donald and Goofy?

Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking about her.

Who are you?

Huh...?

Hey.

Morning.

Huh...?

Hello, Roxas.

Uh... Hi... And you are...?

I wanted to meet you at least once.

Me?

Yes, you.

Olette dragged me along to go shopping.

Hey, you wanna come with us?

Um, uhh, wait... did you just see that...

He's stalling.

Very well, then. We'll see you later, Roxas, okay?

Y-Yeah...

Did she go to that haunted mansion?

Huh?

Lemme go!

Hey, chicken wuss.

Who's that?

I dunno, but they've already crossed the line. Find a weapon!

Not good...

Roxas! Use the Keyblade!

Be careful. Beyond that door lies a completely different world. But don't be afraid.

Don't stop walking...

My name is Naminé. Roxas... Do you remember your true name?

Say no more, Naminé.

But if no one tells him, Roxas will...

It's best he doesn't know the truth.

Hey! You're that pickpocket!

Seifer, strike a pose, y'know?

How's this?

That's totally perfect, y'know!

How 'bout one more, y'know?

What's that for!?

Keepsake.

Those freaks in the white jumpsuits are gone, y'know?

Cakewalk.

What were those things?

Outsiders, that's what.

And if they don't wise up to the rules around here, I might have to take


Oh yeah, Seifer's always lookin' after the town, y'know?

Wait up!

Hey! No chickening out of the tournament tomorrow!

We'll be waitin', y'know?

So...you hung out with Seifer's gang today?

N-no... It's not like that... Oh yeah! How was the beach? Wasn't that today?

We didn't go. It wouldn't be the same without you, right?

...Sorry. Hey...how 'bout we go tomorrow? We could get those pretzels and...

I promised I'd be somewhere.

Ohh... Oh!

You and I have to make the finals! That way, no matter who wins, the four of us split the prize!

Okay, you're on.

You two are gonna clean up!

Go get 'em!

It's a promise!

I'm outta here.

Restoration at 48%.

Was that Naminé made of data?

No. Naminé hijacked the data herself. Look what she's done now... She's totally beyond my control!

Calm down.

It doesn't matter. As long as Naminé accomplishes her goal we needn't worry about what befalls Roxas.

It's up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door and change the world.

But I'm not gonna betray Sora, either.

All for one and one for all.

My friends are my power!

So, your heart won this battle.

It is I, Ansem, lead me into everlasting darkness!

Sora!

Forget it! There's no way you're taking Kairi's heart!

Kairi.

We may never meet again, but we'll never forget each other.

No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.

Take this. It's my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.

Don't worry. I will.

Promise.

Don't ever forget. Wherever you go, I'm always with you.

Right...
...

What a mess...

Hurry to the sandlot! You're gonna be late!

Who you gonna root for?

Both of them, silly.

Ladies and gentlemen, Struggle-fiends of Twilight Town! It's time for summer's most sizzling clash! That's right! Today is the day for the Struggle and title match! Who will be the one to break through the ranks and take on our champion, Setzer!?

Seifer, y'know!?

And who will leave today as our new Struggle Champion!?

Hayner! Roxas!

Setzerrrrr!

Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer!

Yes, the crowd is fired up, so you know what comes next Let's...

STRUGGLE!

Hey, now. It's time to introduce today's combatants! The four bad boys who struggled their way through the preliminaries! Regular finalist and head of the Twilight Disciplinary Committee Seifer! Completely out of nowhere--who knew he'd make it so far this year? Vivi! An underground favorite and local attitude problem Hayner! It's his first trip to the finals! And Struggler number 4, who happens to be my absolute favorite customer Roxas!

So--who will win this sweltering summer Struggle!? Who will take home the grand prize? The summa cum laude of Struggle--- the Four Crystal Trophy! AND...a chance to take on our defending champion, Setzer!

It won't be long now, folks. I suggest our challengers go over the official Struggle Rules before we begin!

Hey... Sorry about yesterday.

What, you still worried about that? You need to learn to let that stuff go.

I've got a lot on my mind.

Sorry, man.

Wait, what am I sorry for?

Our first match of today's Struggle tournament will be between Roxas and his best friend Hayner!

Ready, Roxas?

And the winner is Roxas!

Not even friendship will slow this kid down. And Hayner put up a great fight, too.

I lost. Awww, I can't believe it!

I guess I taught you well.

I had a lot of fun fighting you.

Yeah, well I didn't, wise guy.

Hey, let's find a way to cheer you up.

Nah, that's all right.

Out of the way.

You in a rush to lose?

Don't mess with your elders.

Whew, just look at those sparks fly! I guess Seifer didn't expect to fight one of his own boys!

When did Vivi get so tough?

You're mine!

I-I'm not sure what just happened... Um...but...the winner is Vivi! In a positively blistering comeback!

That's not Vivi.

Huh?

Thrash 'im.

It looks like Seifer's withdrawn from the Struggle for third place.

So I'm in third now? Aw, baby!

Keep it clean, fellas.

And now, the match you've been waiting for Roxas vs. Vivi!

Again!?

Again...

Roxas. All right. Fight fight fight.

You really don't remember? It's me. You know, Axel.

Axel?

Talk about blank with a capital
Man oh man, even the Dusks aren't gonna crack this one.

Wait a sec, tell me what's going on!

This town is his creation, right? Which means we don't have time for a Q & A. You're coming with me, conscious or not. Then you'll hear the story.

Uh-oh.

What's going ON!?

Number 13. Roxas. The Keyblade's chosen one.

Okay, fine! You asked for it!

That's more like it!

Not bad, Roxas.

So it was you.

Roxas, this man speaks nonsense!

Roxas, don't let him deceive you!

Roxas!

Roxas!

Hayner...Pence...Olette... Hayner! Pence! Olette!

What? What just happened?

Huh? ...How did I get here?

Roxas!

Ladies and gentlemen, Roxas--our new top Struggler!

Roxas?

Setzeerrrr!

Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer! Setzer!

Roxas! It's starting!

You two, play fair now. You're at the top of the bracket.

There's only room for one up here.

Well, may the best man win!

Hey, Rucksack. How about you throw the match for me?

Roxas! Focus!

Let me win, and I'll make it worth your while.

Get real!

Roxas, our underdog hero, versus Setzer, our defending champion! The winner of this match will be the true champion! That's bragging rights for a whole year, folks!

Whatever you think is right, you're wrong. And that is a big mistake. My life's a chip in your pile. Time to ante up!

I'm not supposed to lose!

Roxas! Roxas! Roxas! Roxas! Roxas!

Roxas!

You did it!

That was awesome, Roxas!

As promised.

Thanks a ton, Roxas!

One more treasure for us to share.

I've got a present, too...for all of us.

Whoa!

Kairi! Wait up!

Hey, do you feel like going out to the island? Tidus and Wakka are all wrapped up in their ballgame and they won't go with me.

Not today, sorry.

Aw, why not?

Do you remember those boys who used to hang out with us?

Riku?

Yeah.

I wonder whatever happened to him. I sure miss him.

He's far away. But I know we'll see him again.

Sure. Of course we will.

And the other boy?

What other boy?

The one who was with Riku and me all the time---we played together on that island. His voice always used to be there...but now it's gone. I can't think of his face, or his name. I feel awful about it. So I told myself--I'm not going to the island until I remember everything about him.

Are you sure you didn't make him up?

Naminé?

Naminé...? What's happening to me?

Who are you? And that's not my name. I'm Kairi.

Kairi... I know you. You're that girl he likes.

Who? Please, a name!

I'm Roxas.

Okay, Roxas, but can you tell me HIS name?

You don't remember my name? Thanks a lot, Kairi! Okay, I guess I can give you a hint. Starts with an


Are you okay?

Kairi...?

What's that?

A letter... I wrote it yesterday, to the boy I can't remember. I said that no matter where he is... I'll find him. One day. And when I stopped writing, I remembered we made a promise, something important. This letter is where it starts. I know it.

Wow... I hope he gets it.

He will. Starts with an
Right, Sora?

Restoration at 79%.

His progress is astounding.

So what happened?

Naminé's encounter with Roxas put his heart in contact with Kairi's. And that, in turn, affected Sora. You see?

Naminé?... She's a wonder.

She wasn't born like other Nobodies. She can interfere with the hearts and memories of Sora and those aligned with him.

But whose Nobody is she?

I could tell you... But first, perhaps you could tell me your true name?

It's Ansem.

It's an honor, Ansem!

No way!? It's too soon! You can't seriously get rid of him?!

It's an order. Why do you hesitate? You, who has been ruthless towards those who've turned their backs on the Organization?

But it's not like that! He didn't betray us! He can't come back!

If he doesn't return, you know what you must do. Or you will face the consequences.

So, you'll turn me into a Dusk...
Tch, all right! I'll do it, if that's what you want!

I'm dreaming... But which parts...were the dream?

Only three days left of summer vacation--so don't even mention that assignment!

But we agreed we'd get it finished today.

Yesterday... I fell off the station tower, didn't I?

You wouldn't be here if you did!

But man, that was a close one...

Stop changing the subject!

Okay, already! You win. We'll do the homework. Stupid independent study. So, anybody got any bright ideas for a topic?

Maybe we could study the stuff that's happening to me. You know, the dreams--- and the guys in white...

Forget it.

Why?

You know, things have been weird with you and the town since the photos were stolen, right?

Well, tomorrow, we're all gonna search the town and find out what's been goin' on.

Lots of people are helping out.

All that for me?

I'll go get some ice cream!

There's this strange rumor going around. Wanna hear it? You know the stone steps at Sunset Station? We use 'em all the time, without even thinking about it. But---and this is the weird part---the steps count different going up and down!

Seriously!?

And there are six other weird stories like that. It's like...the seven wonders of Twilight Town.

We should investigate those for our school project! Pence, you're a genius!

There might be other rumors going around, too. Let's split up! I'm gonna look for the seven wonders...

Olette and I will go find some new rumors! C'mon!

That leaves you and me, Roxas. Let's try the train first. To the station!

The time has come! Our hunt for the seven wonders begins!

Whoa! Find new rumors already?

Nothing on Market Street.

You twerps aren't gonna scoop us. We're going to the terrace with you.

Hayner, it's not a race!

Well, it is now!

C'mon, we can all go.

Olette! Hurry!

Huh. Aren't these the steps you talked about? The ones that count different going up and down?

Umm...actually, it's the stupidest thing ever, but...

What?

Rai's the one who counted. He's like,
Ha ha ha ha!

So...he just counted wrong?

Hey, no worries.

Oh, it's just you, Roxas. Were you throwing a ball? That ball flew out of nowhere and totally startled me. Hey, I know! This explains one of those seven wonders!

Vivi?

What is it, Roxas?

Oh, did you need this, Roxas? Planning on getting in some practice, I bet.

Er, no, it's just that... there were so many of you...

Huh? So...many of me? I don't get it. Anyway, I'm done with this, Roxas. You can take your time.

So the mystery voice was just Vivi practicing.

Listen, there were a whole bunch of Vivi clones here just a minute ago...

Roxas!

You all right?

Now that's spooky! I thought I saw someone, but it was just my reflection. I bet this is behind one of the seven wonders!

Another...me?

Yikes!

Oh, it was just a dog. Did you let it out of the sack, Roxas?

This explains one of those seven wonders!

You know...that last wonder wasn't exactly wonderful.

I understand, say no more. But this next one's gonna be really great! Wonder number Six!

We got another lead!


...

Everybody knows about Wonder number Six!

Yeah, well, I didn't.

Did you find out where the train runs?

You can see it from Sunset Hill.

If the rumors are true, it'll be here any minute... For they say the train is empty. No driver, no conductor, no passengers... NO RETURN.

We've gotta make it to the beach next year.

Yeah. We better get jobs the second vacation starts.

Good afternoon, slackers.

What are you doing out here?

What do you care?

I don't. Tell me anyway.

We're waiting for the ghost train.

Waiting for the ghost train!

Why does looking at you always tick me off?

I dunno. Maybe it's destiny.

Destiny... In that case, let's be friends. I don't feel like cooperating with destiny.

When have you ever cooperated with anything?

Seifer!

I know. Tomorrow.

Look!

It's really true... And there's really no one aboard! What's the catch? There's gotta be a catch, right?

Then it's real? Let's go to the station!

Let's go in!

What?

Um...you'll get hurt.

Huh?

The train will be arriving shortly.

C'mon.

A train came from the beach. There was no driver, right?

Let's go...

Right?!

Let's go home and work on the paper.




We can still make it sound good if we write about all the work we did.

But what about the last one---the seventh wonder?

Who cares?

I do. C'mon, Pence.

Whatever!

Roxas...

It's at that haunted mansion.

You know something...

We were gonna check the mansion out tomorrow. It IS the most suspicious place.

Right...

Even Seifer's gang was gonna help.

Seifer?

Yeah, Hayner asked him to.

So, what're we lookin' for?

Well, they say there's a girl who appears at the second floor window even though no one's lived here for years.

Roxas...

Naminé?

This is...me? ...And Axel's here too.

You ARE best friends...

Very funny.

Don't you want to know the truth about who you really are?

No one knows me better than me.

Of course...

But...I don't get what's been happening lately.

You know these three, don't you?

Yeah. Sora, Donald, and Goofy. They're from the dreams.

About a year ago, some things happened, and I had to take apart the memories chained together in Sora's heart. But now... I'm putting them all back exactly the way they were. It's taken me a long time, but pretty soon Sora will be his old self again. The process has been affecting you, too, Roxas.

You mean...the dreams?

Yes... You and Sora are connected. And...in order for Sora to become completely whole again... He needs you.

Me? What for?

You hold half of what he is... He needs you, Roxas.

Naminé?

Naminé...who are you?

I'm a witch with power over Sora's memories and those around him.

A witch?

That's what DiZ called me. But I don't know why I have this power...I just do. I'm not even sure there's a right way for me to use it.

Hmm...I can't help you there.
It's funny... Suddenly I feel like I don't know myself at all... I guess I would like to know. What do you know about me...that I don't?

You...you were never supposed to exist, Roxas.

What...? How could you even say such a thing...even if it were true?

I'm sorry. I guess some things really are better left unsaid.

Roxas! Roxas!

Huh?

Did you see her?

Yeah. Watch the window---closely.

Oh, lame. That's just the curtains moving. There must be a draft somewhere. I'm surprised this old place even has curtains.

...Yeah.

Well, let's head back to the usual spot. Hayner and Olette are waiting.

Hey guys, how'd it go?

The girl in the window turned out to be a curtain flapping in the wind.

I figured as much. The report's already done.

All right!

So, wanna go find Hayner? He's probably at the station.

You know...we only have two more days together.

Huh?

Summer vacation, remember?

Oh...right.

Tomorrow we search the town.

Next day's the fair.

The last day of summer.

Don't say that! You'll give me an ulcer!

Not if you explode from all that ice cream first.

Why did you show him the train?

Because he missed the trip to the beach.

Hmph...that's almost kind of you.

Now...what about you? Are the holes in your memory starting to fill in?

Yes...the haze is clearing.

The same thing is happening to everyone who had ties to Sora. Very soon, to them, he'll be like a good friend who's gone away for a year.

I've waited, and now I want to know. What is it that you want?

Revenge.

Revenge...

Now, for the finishing touches. First, we must dispose of Naminé. She did a splendid job with Sora, but it's high time she disappeared. Roxas isn't the only one who was never meant to exist. Take care of it, Ansem.

Restoration at 97%.

Gawrsh, is that all that's left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?

Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right? But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and disconnected, what's gonna happen to this place? And to us?

All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different. You see, darkness is the heart's true essence.

That's not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even give in. But I've learned that deep down, there's a light that never goes out!

Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness!

You're wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts is light!

Now, Sora! Let's close this door for good!

Take care of her.

Kairi!

Sora!

Kairi, remember what you said before? I'm always with you, too. I'll come back to you. I promise!

I know you will!

Well, now what do we do?

We've gotta find Riku and King Mickey.

But, uh, where do we start lookin' for that there door to the light?

Pluto?

Gawrsh, that's the king's seal!

Hey, have you seen King Mickey?

Let's go!

I've been to see him. He looks a lot like you.

Who are you?

Why!? Why do you have the Keyblade?

Shut up!

Man, I could not sleep last night...

Guys?

Huh?

Look at what it's come to. I've been given these icky orders to destroy you---if you refuse to come back with me.

We're...best friends, right?

Sure...but I'm not getting turned into a Dusk for...Wait a sec! You remember now!?

Y...eah.

Great! But, you know, gotta make sure and all. So, umm... What's our boss's name?

Can't believe this...

Roxas, to the mansion! The time has come!

Hayner! Pence! Olette!

The Roxas that I know is long gone. Fine, I see how it is...

Don't call me and then lock me out...

Your mind's made up?

Why did the Keyblade choose me? I have to know.

You can't turn on the Organization!

Organization XIII... they're a bad group.

Bad or good, I don't know. They're a group of incomplete people who wish to be whole. To that end, they're desperately searching for something.

What?

Kingdom Hearts.

Funny?

It's just, I think---I've been running away from the question I really wanna ask

What's gonna happen to me now? Just tell me that. Nothing else really matters anymore.

You are...

Naminé!

There's no knowledge that has the power to change your fate.

Even if it doesn't, I wanna know. I have the right to know!

A Nobody doesn't have a right to know. Nor does it even have the right to be.

But what IS a Nobody!?

DiZ, we're out of time. Too many Nobodies!

Roxas. Nobodies like us are only half a person. You won't disappear. You'll be whole!

I'll...disappear...?

No further outbursts!

No, you won't disappear! You'll--

Wait!

Roxas! We will meet again. And then we can talk about everything. I may not know it's you, and you may not know it's me. But we will meet again. Someday soon. I promise!

Let her go!

Naminé!

Why!? Why do you have the Keyblade?

Shut up!

Will it work?

If we can maintain the simulated town until Naminé finishes chaining together Sora's memories.

What will happen to Roxas?

He holds half of Sora's power within him. In the end, he'll have to give it back.

Until then, he'll need another personality to throw off his pursuers.

Poor thing.

It's the fate of a Nobody.

Simply amazing, Roxas.

Axel.

You really do remember me this time? I'm SO FLATTERED.

But you're too late!!

Two!?

Come here. I'll make it all stop.

Roxas...

You get on their bad side and they'll destroy you!

No one would miss me.

That's not true... I would.

Axel...

Let's meet again in the next life.

Yeah. I'll be waiting.

Silly. Just because you have a next life...

...Donald. ...Goofy?

At last, the Keyblade's chosen one.

Who are you talking to? Me? Or Sora?

To half of Sora, of course. You reside in darkness. What I need is someone who can move about the realm of light and destroy Organization XIII.

Why? Who are you?

I am a servant of the world.
And if I'm a servant, then you should consider yourself a tool, at best.

Was that... Was that supposed to be a joke?

'Cause I'm not laughing!

My apologies. This is only a data-based projection.

Come, over here.

I hate you so much...

You should share some of that hatred with Sora. He's far too nice for his own good.

No! My heart belongs to me!

Sora...

You're lucky. Looks like my summer vacation is...over.

Sora?

Who's there?

Sora!

Sora, wake up.

Donald, Goofy!

That was some nap!

You mean, we were asleep?

I guess we musta been, or I don't think we'd be so drowsy...

When do ya think we went to sleep?

Uhh...

Let's see...we defeated Ansem...

Yep.

...restored peace to the world...found Kairi... Oh yeah, and then we went to look for Riku. I think that's right so far.

Then what?

What does your journal say, Jiminy?

Gee, there's only one sentence...
Hmm... I wonder who that is.

Some journal that is.

Well, what do ya say we find out where we are!

You know, I think I've been to this town.

What's it called?

Hmm... Guess I must've imagined it.

What do you want!?

Uh, nothing. Just wondering what was back here.

Now you know. This is our spot.

Umm...

What?

You're...new around here, right? I'm Pence.

Hayner. Nice to meet you, but we got stuff to do, so catch ya later.

My name's Olette. Hey, did you finish up the summer homework, yet? Independent studies are the worst, huh?

Homework?

Hey, what're your names?

Oh, sorry. We're Sora, Donald, and Goofy.

Hey there.

Sora, Donald, Goofy, we just met someone who was looking for you.

He sure seemed in a hurry. He had a black coat on so I couldn't see his face, but he had these big round ears.

The King!

Where'd you see him?

At the station.

The station! Thanks!

Well, we'd better get back to that assignment.

Later.

Oh boy! The King's trying to find us!

Yeah, let's get to the station!

Hey you, where'd you come from?

Uhh...

You here to pick a fight with us or something?

Fight? We're not here to fight.

Yeah, you big palooka!

Okay, smartalecks... Time to teach you how to behave in my town. Bring it!

Man, what a jerk.

One moment!

If you're gonna fight, why not make it a proper Struggle?

What?

You see, Seifer... I'm a really big fan.

Wh-what do you want?

In other words, I want to see more of your
moves! You handled the tournament with real style, and you absolutely dominated the title match. But I just can't get enough. Don't you see? The matches are far too short!

And what's your name?

Sora.

Sora, if you wanna fight a match, you just say the word.

Your Majesty?

Shh! You gotta board the train and leave town! The train knows the way.

Here.

Your Majesty...

The King... Was that really him?

It coulda been... Yep, I know it was!

Now we know he's okay!

The King was locked in the realm of darkness, right?

Uh-huh.

But we just saw him...

Yep.

And if the King is here, that means Riku's here!

He's gotta be!

Well, I'm gonna go look for Riku. Then he and I can go back to the islands together. Kairi's there waiting for us! What are you two gonna do?

Gawrsh, Sora. Do ya have to ask?

Hey! What's so funny!?

Your face!

What do ya say, guys? Let's stick together for one more journey.

To...where again?

We hafta board the train!

Oh yeah.

C'mon!

Wait up!

Hey, Sora...

What?

Nothing, but...

We came to see you off. It just seemed like something we oughta do.

Oh...really? Thanks!

You should hurry and get your tickets.

Right.

What is it?

They're the same.

Yeah.

Three tickets, please!

I can't help feeling like we won't see this town again...

Why not?

You're thinkin' too much.

Yeah, you're right!

Okay, let's go!

Bye.

Hey, Sora. You sure we haven't met before?

Positive. Why do you ask?

I dunno.

Huh?

You okay?

Y-yeah. Don't know where it came from.

Pull it together.

Right... See ya.

You know...

I'm sad.

We'll be back.

Yeah. We can visit Hayner and those guys again.

Guess that's that.

Let's go.

Go where? It's not like we have homes to return to. We don't exist, remember?

Yes, it's true. We may not have homes. But there is someplace I want to go... And someone I want to see...

Same here.

So, you think you might let us go? I know you're here to get rid of us, but...

DiZ wants to get rid of me?

Go.

You sure about this?

I owe you both.

For what?

Castle Oblivion. You helped us.

Heh, you don't have to tell me twice.

Thank you.

There goes our ride...

What's goin' on?

I sent some of my lackeys inside to see if the master of this here tower's as big and tough as they say. Word is, he's a real powerful sorcerer. Which would make him the perfect bodyguard for me. See, it don't matter how tough he is---once he's a Heartless, he'll do as I say!

A Heartless?

That's right. They're those things that come outta the darkness in folks' hearts. Why, with all those Heartless at her side, my dear friend Maleficent is gonna conquer everything! And since I got me a debt to pay, I'm goin' 'round to a bunch of different worlds and buildin' an army of Heartless, special for her. Why am I talkin' to you pipsqueaks anyway? Go on, scram! I'm behind schedule as it is.

You oughta find somethin' nicer to do.

Says who?

Wha...AAAH! It's you!

Pete!

What are you two nimrods doin' here!?

What are YOU doing here?

You know him?

We sure do! Pete's been causin' trouble for ages! His Majesty banished him to another dimension a long time ago. I wonder how he escaped.

You wanna know how, eh? Well, Maleficent busted me out, that's how! And now your world---no, no, no, all the worlds---are gonna belong to yours truly. Cause Maleficent's gonna help me conquer 'em!

Maleficent...huh.

What are you laughing at!? Why, Maleficent's power is so great---

She's toast!

Huh?

Sorry, but Maleficent can't help ya now.

Whaddaya mean!?

You! So you're the ones that did it!

Well...we mighta had something to do with it.

Heartless squad! Round up!

You just wait! Nobody, and I do mean nobody, messes with the mighty Pete!

So,
Pete, who lives in this tower, anyway?

Oh, ya don't know, eh? Well, it's old Yen Sid. 'Course he's probably a Heartless by now!

Master Yen Sid lives here!?

Yen Sid is the King's teacher!

Wow. Sounds powerful!

Heartless, Heartless, Heartless! Things haven't changed one bit!

Well, it's a good thing we're on the job, then.

So the worlds aren't at peace after all?

Master Yen Sid! It's an honor!

Hey there!

Sora! Show some respect!

So, you are Sora. Now then, have you seen the King yet?

Yes, we did, Master. But we didn't get a chance to talk to him.

Yes...the King has been quite busy of late. Therefore, it would seem that the task of instructing you three falls upon my shoulders. You have a perilous journey ahead of you. You must be well prepared.

You mean...we have to go on another quest? I was looking forward to finding my friend Riku, so we could go back to the islands.

Yes. I know. However, everything in your journey, Sora, is connected. Whether you will find your way home to the islands... Whether you will return alone or with your friend... And, whether or not the islands will still be there. And the key that connects them all is you, Sora.

I'm...the key?

Chosen wielder of the Keyblade! You are the key that will open the door to light.

This book contains valuable knowledge you will need for your journey. Study it carefully. Once you have finished, we will speak of the enemies you will surely confront.

But wait a sec---how come the Heartless are still running around?

Your past endeavors did prevent an immense effusion of Heartless from the great darkness; make no mistake about that. However, the Heartless are darkness made real---and darkness lingers yet in every heart. The Heartless are fewer. But while darkness exists in a single heart, it will be difficult to eliminate them.

Gawrsh, that must mean...if everybody's heart was full of light, them Heartless'd go away!

Now it is time to speak of the enemies that you will encounter.

If one such as you, Donald, yields to the darkness in their heart, they too will become a Heartless. But you know this. The Heartless are always lurking and ever seeking to capture new hearts. Never let your guard down! Now then...

At times, if someone with a strong heart and will---be they evil or good---becomes a Heartless, the empty shell they leave behind begins to act with a will of its own.

An empty vessel whose heart has been stolen away... A spirit that goes on even as its body fades from existence---for you see, Nobodies do not truly exist at all. Nobodies may seem to have feelings, but this is a ruse---they only pretend to have hearts. You must not be deceived!

Nobodies... They don't exist...

Now then...the being you see before you is known as a Dusk. They are the most common form of Nobody. But there are others---some larger, some with frightening and unique powers. Be vigilant! On your journey, you will meet an alarming number of Dusks. They will all attempt to do you harm.

Still, they are nothing but empty shells, destined to return to the darkness. But---

The beings you see before you now are different. These powerful Nobodies have formed a group called Organization XIII. It commands the lesser Nobodies.

Organization XIII...

While Heartless act on instinct, Nobodies function in a higher manner. They can think and plan. And it seems they are working towards a goal. What that goal is, we do not know. The King sensed the danger, and journeyed forth to fight it. He found the dark realm's Keyblade, and with it, closed the door. Now he's traveling from world to world, fighting the Heartless as he seeks the answer to the riddle of the Nobodies and Organization XIII.

Then I guess we better go find the King first!

But where could he be?

Well, we won't know 'til we look.

Yeah. And the King must know where Riku is, 'cause the two of them were together in the realm of darkness when we closed the door. You know, after defeating Ansem.

So, before you go, you will need more suitable traveling clothes. Those look a bit too small for you.

Through there, you'll find three good fairies. If you ask, they'll create for you appropriate garments.

Gawrsh, Sora, you sure are growing fast.

Uh, I guess...

Me, you guys, Riku, and the King. I don't care who this Organization is or what it's planning. With the five of us---I mean, six of us---there's nothing to worry about, right?

Yeah!

Well, look who's here, dears! Sora, Donald, and Goofy!

Ooh, if you're looking for clothes, you've come to the right place!

I'll do the designing.

Oh, that will never do.

Now, now, dears.

But don't you like this better?

Hold on!

Are you certain?

Blue!

Aww, would you just decide?

All right, then. Together now, dears. And no more squabbling!

Oh, my!

Ooh, it's lovely.

Oh, yes! He does look very dashing.

Now, those aren't ordinary garments.

They have very special powers.

Take the orb, dear.

And watch what happens.

Whoa!

Wow!

Two Keyblades!

This journey's gonna be twice as difficult as your last.

Your garments also have other powers---but you will have to discover what they are as you continue on your journey.

Okay, I'll do my best. And thanks a lot!

Oh, and there's something else for you---from Master Yen Sid.

Oh boy!

Hey! It's the Gummi Ship!

So you guys ready to go?

Now, now, just a moment.

Because of your previous endeavors, the worlds have returned to their original states. That means the pathways between them have disappeared.

How do we get around?

Do not fear. If what the King suspected proves true, the worlds have prepared new pathways along which you may travel. These pathways may be utilized by unlocking special gates. How these gates are opened, I'm afraid I do not know... However, the Keyblade will serve as your guide. When a beam of light radiates from the Keyblade, return to the Gummi Ship. Though the worlds may seem far apart and out of reach, they nonetheless remain connected by invisible ties. As do our hearts.

Our hearts are connected.

That is correct.

Got it!

But be warned. As you proceed... The Heartless and the Nobodies will be using their own paths Corridors of darkness, to travel from world to world. They may be attempting to link these dark pathways to the gates between the worlds.

Hey! That's not fair!

Now then, that is all the information I can give to you. Go forth, Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Everyone is waiting.

Okay, let's get going!

Master Yen Sid!

We sure do appreciate the help.

My goodness, what's that!?

Haven't we seen this somewhere before?

Yes, dear. I wonder whose it was...

Oh, Malefi---

No! We mustn't remember her name! Oh dear...

She was a mean ol' witch! Oh no! The memories are coming back! What'll we go!? Oooh---what'll we do!?

Perhaps we should tell Master Yen Sid.

Yes. That's what we must do. Hurry!

Maleficent!

Howdy, Sora! How ya doin'?

It's your favorite Gummi engineers here, ready for duty Chip...

...and Dale!

Happy flying!

Only one?

That's no good!

Wait! I think it's a world we know!

Maleficent! Maleficent!

Maybe they really did finish her off.

And this castle sure ain't what I expected. No shine, no nothin'.

Now what's gonna happen to our plan?

It's Hollow Bastion!

Gawrsh, it looks kinda different now.

I hope Leon and the gang are doing okay.

Uh-oh. Looks like we're gonna have to do some fightin'.

Uncle Scrooge!?

Er, who?

He's Donald's uncle---a business typhoon! Before the Heartless showed up, he traveled the worlds on a Gummi Ship with the King. He was helpin' to set up a traffic system.

A transit system!

What's all the racket?

Why, if it isn't Donald! And Goofy! Hello, lads! Aye, you all look hale and hearty!

So do you, Uncle Scrooge.

Ah, if only I were... I canna seem to recreate my favorite old-time ice cream. I'd make millions if I just got it right...

Terrible...!

Hey, what's going on?

That's the town's defense mechanism.

Yuffie!

Look out!

Hey, you guys!

I see you're still in top form.

What'd you expect?

Looks like you're doing okay.

Well, what did YOU expect?

How are the others?

Great!

Hey, Yuffie! Have you seen the King and Riku?

Nope.

But I had a feeling I'd see you guys again.




Is that supposed to be Leon?

Everybody's working on stuff over at Merlin's house. C'mon!

Meet the Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee!

We missed you!

Well, if you ain't in top shape.

I knew it.

Knew what?

A while back, everyone suddenly remembered you guys, all at the same time.

You...remembered? Wait! Does that mean you forgot about us!?

Thanks!

So where've you guys been all this time?

We were sleepin'.

Where? In cold storage?

It doesn't matter. This is great. Everyone's together again!

So, um...we're trying to find Riku and the King. Have you seen 'em?

Right.

Sorry. But let us know if there's anything we can do to help. Okay?

Okay. Thanks.

Don't go thankin' us just yet.

Hollow Bastion's got a problem. A big problem.

You mean, like Nobodies? And Heartless?

That's right!

Sounds like you could use our help.

Then let's cut to the chase. Sora, Donald, Goofy. We were hoping the three of you might give us a hand around here.

Like we're gonna say, no?

...I forgot who I'm dealing with.

Hey...what do you mean by that?

Just think of it as a sort of


Follow me to the bailey---there's something you need to see.

Oh! I thought it was you. Right on time!

It's Merlin!

Sora and the gang said they're gonna help out!

Splendid! We'll count on you!

Right!

Ah, yes. Did you give them the cards, dear?

Oh!

Here...they're presents for you. Leon thought you might like to have them.

Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee Honorary Member!

Membership cards!

Kinda cool, huh?

Hey, thanks, Leahhh...huh?

Oh no! We're supposed to be at the bailey!

Just a moment, Sora. What about your magic?

Huh? Oh, that's right...

Maybe you forgot it while you were asleep!

Now, what am I to do with you? I suppose I'll have to lend you a few spells. But be careful with them!

Thanks, Merlin!

To the bailey, and fast!

Look at that.

We want to restore Hollow Bastion to what it used to be. Who knows---maybe even something better. There's still a lot to do, but I'm sure we can handle everything--- Except...for that...

...and that.

We'll handle 'em!

Well, that's good to hear. So Sora---do you know what's going on, then?

There's this guy, Pete, who's been going around plotting with the Heartless. But he's not smart enough to tie his own shoes. The ones we need to worry about are the Nobodies.

And those Organization XIII guys in charge, too!

You called?

You're doing well.

Who's that!?

This calls for a celebration...

The Keyblade...a truly marvelous weapon. Were it only in more...capable hands...

Show yourselves!

Organization XIII!

Good! Now we can settle this!

What a shame... And here I thought we could be friends.

Stop!

What's the big idea!?

Oopsy-daisy!

Move!

Now, do you think that's polite, shutting me down like that?

I said get outta the way! ?????? As if! You can talk all you want, but that won't change a thing.

Then we're gonna MAKE you move!

See, that would work---if I were just any old dude. 'Cept I'm not. I'm with the Organization. Nothing
about me.

Ha! Tough talk for someone who stood on the sidelines while his Nobody flunkeys did the fighting!

Oh, dear. I think you got the wrong impression.

You gonna cry?

As if! Why don't I remind you how tough the crowd you're dealing with really is?

Remind me?

That's RIGHT, he used to give me that same exact look.

I guess you think you can psych me out by saying really random stuff!

Gee... I just don't know.

Be a good boy now!

Wait!

Nuts! He got away!

That was weird. WHO gave him the same look?

Y'know, I think he was just tryin' to confuse ya.

Yeah, you're right. Only one me!

The Hollow Bastion Restoration Committee Honorary Member---

Huh?

What's this?

Gawrsh, ya think...?

Ohh...now I get it. That must've been the gate Yen Sid talked about.

Oh boy!

Sorry to run, Leon, but other worlds are calling.

Organization XIII... They look tough. Be careful out there.

See ya soon.

Do my eyes deceive me? Does he really have the power to wield the Keyblade. He's nothing but a boy.

Give him a chance. It means he's straight as an arrow.
He's pure of heart, unlike all of us here.

He'd better be, or else he's worthless.

I truly hope he's enjoying himself on his adventure.

Maybe he'd like a hand to determine his fate.

Hey, as long as it works in our favor! We can let him do what he wants for now. Then we'll all jump in if needed!

Those are bold words coming from you. Are you saying you'll volunteer to take care of it if things go wrong?

Huh? What?! Me?! No, you have the wrong guy... I'm not comfortable with that.

You act as though you have a conscience... When was the last time any one of us felt anything?

Truer words were never spoken.
Well, I suppose, the fun will have to wait.

Do you know what happens to those who lose their true purpose? Inevitably, they destroy themselves.

Gentlemen.

The hero of the Keyblade has embarked on a new adventure. Make sure it is one he will remember. Now, go.

Hey! What happened to Twilight Town?

It's gone!

See that, Mulan? It's Shan-Yu, leader of the Hun army! C'mon, girl. This is your big chance!

I can see it now
You gonna be famous! I'm talkin' A-list!

Mushu, I'm not sure... I haven't even joined the army yet. I have to take my father's place to preserve the Fa family honor. I just hope I don't get discovered.

Whatever. You just scared---admit it.

Aren't you?

A Heartless?

Let's get the jump on 'im!

Gawrsh, maybe we better look before we leap.

Is that Mushu?

That's right, I know you heard of me! I'm little, lethal, and legendary! Now y'all scram before I get my dragon dander up!

Hey, Mushu! We missed you!

Yeah, well you better HOPE I miss YOU, or else you're---you're...Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Do you know them?

Know them? Man, we used to kick all kinds of bad guy butt together! Yeah, you know, I helped these guys out of a lot of tight spots. 'Cause I'm a mighty dragon! Right?

Something like that. And...you are?

I'm Mulan. Um, no, I-I mean...

Ping!

Mulan Ping?

Just...Ping. I am Ping, son of Fa Zhou.

You know Mushu?

Mushu's one of my family's guardians.

We didn't know we were borrowin' somebody as important as a family guardian.

Yeah, that's right!

And that puts you three up to your eyeballs in debt to Ping here.

Well, guess what, kiddies? It's payback time!

Mushu...

Ah, they don't mind. Ain't that right?

Hmm, sounds fair.

See, Ping here was just on his way to join the Imperial army.

We gotta go find the other recruits over at the training camp.

Would you join us? It'll be easier to fit in if I'm with guys, like you.

What do you mean,
?

Well, um, uh, don't---don't worry about that.

You're pretendin' to be a boy, aren't ya?

You're a...girl?

You didn't notice?

Uh-uh.

Not me.

I think it's working.

I don't know---those two would fall for anything.

I'm right here!

Hey!

Remember, girl---manly!

'Bout time we got some grub.

Hey, no cutting!

Get out!

Back off!

Uh-oh!

Hey, a space in line!

I wonder what they're serving for lunch today.

Knuckle sandwiches!

That does it!

Please!

Please!

What a girl!

Uh...knock it off!

Knock what off?

You punched me!

Cutting in line!

What a shrimp!

Who you callin' a shrimp, panda lips? I'm a bona fide guardian dragon!

L-let's just get back in line, okay?

Whose side are you on? I just got slugged!

Want some more?

Soldiers! Get back in line!

The Captain!

What are they?

Heartless!

Oh yeah?

Ping, I hope you're ready!

You three. What are your names?

Sora.

Donald.

Goofy.

You're welcome in my troop. Your battle skills are encouraging.

I am the son of Fa Zhou---

You should return home.

B-but... That would dishonor my family!

You'd rather dishonor my troops?

Don't make me---!

If Ping trains hard and does his best, he'll get stronger in no time.

Hmm...

Just give us an assignment! We'll show you how well we can work together.

So...you want to be tested? Our orders are to ambush Shan-Yu's army on their way here. They should be coming through the mountain pass.

We'll smash them!

I doubt that. You four will be the advance party. Scout out the mountain for my troops.

That's it? No problem. Right?

R-right.

I'll brief you on the details later. Return when you're ready to depart. Remember, the smallest mission may have the greatest purpose. Stay alert!

Sir!

Have you decided you're up for a mission? A strange figure was seen at the Checkpoint! Head there quickly and defeat the enemy!

You've done a passable job. But stay alert! This is just the beginning. Shan-Yu has invaded our country. We must stop him at all costs. A mob is heading for the Checkpoint. Stop them while keeping an eye out for strange enemies!

Hmm, not bad. Now brace yourself for the rest of your assignments. Our objective is to defeat Shan-Yu. Do not fail your mission. It seems the enemy has invaded the camp. Defeat every enemy you encounter!

Yes, that's exactly what I need from you. Now, you still have some tasks to do. Stay sharp. You did well.

I knew it!

Captain...

I suppose you've made a little progress...

Not a little---a lot!

No. You're right, Captain. Please give me one more assignment. This time I'll show you what I'm truly made of!

I'll give you one more chance. See me when you're ready to depart. Remember, this may be a test, but it's still an important mission. Be alert!

Sir!

Your mission is to secure the path over the summit so our company can pass. I've authorized you to be let through to the summit. Don't let me down!

Hey, you ain't half bad.

A man among men!

Thanks!

But the Captain...

Captain!

Ping sure did great!

You bet he did!

Hmm...Fine. I'll let you join my troops... But I'm still not convinced you have what it takes to be a worthy soldier.

Why not!?

It's all right, Sora. I'll find a way to show him what I'm made of. Just give me a chance.

That's the spirit, Ping.

Sir!

Good going, Ping!

Thanks!

Okay, girl! Here's your chance! I just saw this real shady guy. And I know it's Shan-Yu.

Shan-Yu!?

That's the Hun leader! We've got to tell the Captain!

Right!

Waaaait wait-wait-wait WAIT! Everybody use their heads a sec. Now, why are we here? To make the Captain see Mulan's---I mean, Ping's talents and bring honor to her family.

So, let's go find out where Shan-Yu is, by ourselves. Then, if we're lucky, we can fry him up good! Though just tracking the guy down should earn us our stars... Captain Musclehead will have to notice my girl!

Okay. Let's go.

We'll help out.

Now we're cookin'! Shan-Yu is in a cave outside the village!

Dead end.

There's nobody here...

You're crazy. Check again!

Oh, well...

Wait for me, Donald!

Hey, wait up!

Huh?

What? What is it?

Sora!

Ping!

Nice fighting, Ping! You were amazing.

You okay?

Yeah, thanks to Ping.

C'mon! Time to report to the Captain!

But Shan-Yu wasn't here.

Please! That Hun is old news! We're gonna tell the Captain how thousands of Heartless stormed the cave, and Ping took out almost every one of 'em!

Captain!

Don't overdo it, Captain!

It's just a scratch.

Captain, the enemy! Where did they go?

They went toward the summit...

We'll stop them!

It kinda is our fault.

Right.

You mean MY fault.

Uh-uh!

Shan-Yu and the Heartless did this, not us! Captain, if you track down the villagers, we'll handle this.

Let's go.

Attack!

Stand back!

We'll handle this!

Sorry!

Oh, a flint, flint, I need so---huh...

Me, hey, whoa! Whoa! Wait a second! Ah!

You're going the wrong way!

Yes!

Captain?

Look out!

Run for it!

Thanks, Ping.

It...was nothing.

I should never have doubted you. From now on, you have my trust.

Thank you, Captain.

First she uses me as a lighter, then she turns me into a cannon ball. The head ancestor's gonna hear about this. You know, that's it! I give up! I can't take this no more. C'mon, Mulan. Let's quit this charade and go home, girl.

Mushu!

Huh?

Mulan? A woman? It can't be!

Ping! Captain!

Oh boy, you're okay!

You all knew, didn't you? You knew Ping was really a woman in disguise.

I can't believe you lied to me. The punishment for high treason and dishonoring the Army...is death. Get out of my sight...now. You're all dismissed.

But Captain...

My debt is repaid.

The Emperor is waiting! Move out!

Mulan... I blew it.

Thank you, everyone. Sorry I got you in trouble.

It's no big deal. So Ping... I mean, uh, Mulan...what're you gonna do now?

Go back home.

You know, your daddy's gonna be steamed as a chicken dumpling.

Relax, we'll take our share of the blame.

Thanks. You're all wonderful friends.

Shan-Yu!

He's alive!

He's heading for the Imperial City! We've got to warn Shang!

---Shang!

Shan-Yu is alive! He's headed this way!

And why should I believe you this time?

But...she's telling you the truth!

Guard the palace! Do not let the enemy get anywhere near the Emperor!

That's an order!

Captain! We'll secure the courtyard, and you can save the Emperor!

That's an order!

The Emperor's in danger!

No time to lose!

Now you'll bow to me!

It ends now!

Right now!

Now that's what I call burning some hunny-bun! Aw, yeah! Mulan's the best! Mulan's the best! No, wait a minute---I'm the best! Mushu's the best! Mushu's the best!

I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.

You stole your father's armor, ran away from home, impersonated an Imperial soldier. You deceived your commanding officer, shamed the entire Chinese army, and dishonored your family name.

We get the picture...

You're a young woman. And in the end...

...you have saved us all.

Your Excellency!

Captain Li?

Take this, so the world will know what it is you have done for China.

Thank you.

Mulan.

Yes?

Sora.

Sir.

Donald.

Wak!

Goofy.

Yes, sir.

Thank you.


? Is that all there is to say, Captain? If you wish to win the heart of Fa Mulan, China's bravest woman, you'll have to be a bit more eloquent than that!

Can I get an autograph?

Thanks for everything, Sora.

Now they GOTTA let me go back to bein' a guardian! They GOTTA!

But Mushu, I thought you already WERE a family guardian!

What? Oh, no, no---don't even worry about that, that's just real technical. Just for us guardians.

You tricked us!

No, no no no, see I did---I just, uh...

You know, I just didn't wanna bog y'all down with all the Guardian-ese. See, it's very complex, a lot of fine print. You wouldn't understand.

Huh?

Okay!

Guess it's about time to be movin' on.

You shall be missed.

Is it okay if we come back to visit?

Of course!

We will look forward to your return.

You two play nice.

Whoa... Watch it, soldier!

Goodbye, Sora, Donald, Goofy!

Hey, what is this place?

It's huge!

And sorta gloomy, don't ya think?

I wonder who lives here.

Hey, does anybody else recognize that?

Hey! That's the Beast!

Yeah.

Maybe we should check up on him.

Look!

C'mon!

Where did it go?

Found it!

Aw, c'mon! Enough already!

Somebody help us!

Just in time!

Gee, do ya think he maybe forgot who we are?

With this many Heartless around, something must be up.

Why'd he have to do that?

What is it?

I just know I saw a lady at the top of those stairs...

Well... If the Beast is here in the castle, that lady musta been Belle, right?

Yeah, maybe so. Belle might know what's happened to the Beast, too.

C'mon! Let's go find her!

Shhh!

What am I going to do?

Okay.

Donald!

Hey! Who opened the door?

Oh, I'm so happy you're here!

Donald! Sora! Goofy!

Hiya!

Put me down! Put me down!

Where's the Beast?

Oh, he must be in the west wing. We don't talk like we used to.

Did something happen?

Yes. Isn't that why you're here?

Not exactly. But we can still help!

Since we're here and all.

The Beast won't talk to you?

He's been acting strange lately. The only ones who might know why are locked up in the dungeon. I want to help them, but...

Wait a second. Who locked who up?

The Beast locked up his servants.

But why?

That's what I don't know.

Hmm. Where's this dungeon?

You can get to the undercroft from the west hall. The dungeon is down there.

West hall. Got it.

Be careful!

There should be a way into the undercroft around here...

Here it is!

Do you MIND!?

And I was just starting to get comfortable... May I help you?

Huh? What? Oh, right---Belle needs us to go to the dungeon.

Goodness! You're here to help my friends? Well, why didn't you say so?

Er...

I'm sorry I startled you. Oh, I used to be human, you know, until the enchantress cast her spell. I was turned into a wardrobe when the prince was turned into a beast.

The prince is the Beast!?

The Beast is a prince!?

That's right. Although his behavior was far from princely at the time.

What's this about a...spell?

Well, it was a cold winter's night...

And that's enough for now. You can hear the rest when you've rescued the others. It'll give you something to look forward to.

Aww...

Hurry, now. The dungeon is damp and chilly. Certainly no place for a clock!

A clock?

You'll find out soon enough.

All right. Let's get going.

This must be it.

Uh-oh!

You think the dungeon's past this door?

C'mon, we gotta set those servants free!

He's right. Let's go.

There's nobody here.

You mean there's nobody to rescue?

Did someone say
?

Shhh! Keep quiet. It might be THEM.

Oh, they look like nice boys to me.

We are nice. We're your friends.

Yeah. Belle sent us to find you.

I'm Sora. Donald. Goofy.

...D-don't touch! I-I am self-winding, sir!

I'm glad you're okay.

It is we who are overjoyed to see you!

Did somebody put a spell on you guys, too?

Yes, that's right! You've heard! It was the enchantress.

It seems so long ago...

It was a cold winter's night... An old beggar woman came to the castle, and asked for shelter.

But the master of this castle, that is of course, the Prince...

Stop that! Put me down this instant!

Thank you!

The master turned her away. All because of her, ahem, meager appearance.

That's awful!

Oui. He was a spoiled prince, so selfish and...how shall I say...cruel.

Lumiere!

The old woman warned our master not to be deceived by appearances... Still, he would not take her in.

Then the old woman's ugliness melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.

She turned the Prince into a beast, a shape she thought fitting for his cold heart.

And to further punish him, everyone in the castle was enchanted, too.

Wow... That's quite a story.

Is there anything we can do to help?

Let's get the enchantress!

Oh no, dear.

We already know what needs to be done, but with the master out of sorts...

He sure is acting weird.

It's almost as if he's forgotten how to trust others.

You don't suppose he's been turned into a Heartless, do you?

Heartless!?

If they're a part of this, then it's a good thing we're here.

Let's go find the Beast!

Splendid!

Follow me, messieurs. I know a shortcut.

Allow our guests to pass!

After you.

I'm afraid we won't be marching out that easily. You see, the door leading to the other side is concealed by a sort of contraption.

What kind of contraption?

Observe.

The lantern came down!

Indeed it did. If we could but light all the lanterns in this passage the secret door would open...

But, as you can see, the lanterns are already burning---with an enchanted flame.

You must put out this enchanted flame before I am able to light the lanterns properly.

Can't ya just throw some water on 'em?

I'm afraid that's not enough. But if you use the power of light...

Hmm... How about I try using the Keyblade?

Bravo!

Only three lanterns left! If we work together, we'll have that door open in no time!

Piece of cake!

Again, it is not quite so simple, mon ami. Certainly you cannot expect Cogsworth to hang from that handle forever?

What? Why? Lumiere! You---

If he gets tired and falls off, all the unlit lanterns will rise to the ceiling again.

Before you can continue, you must see to Cogsworth. Once he gets his strength back, he'll grasp the lever again for you.

Let's give it a shot!

Are we all set?

Oui. The secret door should open now.

But I don't see any secret door.

No need to worry. Just push that block over there---the one that's sticking out.

Got it.

Now, I must check on the castle. I fear my absence has been too long.

I'd best be off, too, dears.

Watch out for the Heartless!

The master's room is at the very end of the west wing. I shall go on ahead and wait for you.

It's time you dealt with Belle. She's scheming to take everything you have. This castle, your precious rose. And then---your life. Trust no one. Feed your anger! Only anger will keep you strong.

I've had enough of strength. There's only one thing I want---

What? To love, and be loved in return? Who could ever love a beast?

See? She has accomplices.

Hey, Prince!

Oh dear! Master!

Please, Master! Please! Compose yourself!

Cogsworth...what happened?

Well, Master...ah, you see...that is... How shall I say...ah, actually...mmm...

Well, you put everybody down there in that dungeon!

I did what?

Ah...you did!

Who was that guy you were talking to? The one in black?

Xaldin... that's his name. He came from the darkness... He...used my anger to control me. He took all my sorrow, my sadness, my pain---and turned it all into rage. There was nothing I could do... I could no longer see the truth.

Well, I'll be. That must be why you threw all of your friends down there into the dungeon. You wanted to make sure that you didn't hurt 'em, right?

Was that it? Was it to protect them?

Sure. We know you're good inside.

He's right, Master. We've all seen how kind you can be. After all... Belle can see the goodness in your heart, but I'm afraid you've yet to---

Belle!

I've mistreated her... I've mistreated her and been so selfish.

She didn't say anything about that.

She'd never tell anyone of my cruelty... She's too good.

You see, I'm afraid he judges himself far too harshly.

Why don't you just go talk to her?

But...

No excuses! C'mon, we'll go with you.

Master!

Everybody's safe now.

Wonderful! Thank you!

Where is Belle?

Why, she left in a hurry. Something about going after this...man in black.

WHAT!? Why doesn't she do as she's told?

Temper, temper! Her spirit is what makes Belle so special.

We'd better go find her!

I'm warning you! You'll be sorry!

Belle! Where are you?

Beast! Help! I'm in the ballroom!

Belle!

I'm all right!

We did it!

So you think.

Xaldin!

Farewell.

What does he want here?

He must be with Organization XIII. Ever heard of the Nobodies? When a strong-hearted person turns into a Heartless, a Nobody's created, too. See, the Organization...they've got control of all the Nobodies.

That's right. And they were gonna make you into a Heartless. That way, they could get that Nobody of yours and have control over it.

You're alright!

Belle!

Belle... I-I'm sorry---I...wasn't myself. I hope I haven't done anything to hurt you.

Forgive me.

I know you weren't yourself. You don't have to apologize. But I had hoped...that you might have changed a little bit.

I wish you could start trusting me.

Oh, I am afraid time is running short.

What do you mean?

Remember the rose?

From the Beast's room?

Precisely. You see, if the master can learn to love, and earn love in return, before the last petal falls...

...the spell will be broken.

Really? You think he's gonna make it?

We think so.

Yep, I think you're right.

I HOPE you're right...

What happened?

The gate is open!

Do you have to go?

Yeah.

Now, no more arguin', okay?

We'll see to it.

Take care, dears.

You're welcome here anytime.

If you hear anything about Riku or the King, the Heartless, the Organization---anything at all---let us know!

Okay, gotta go!

Bye bye!

Huh?

Hey, wait a minute... Is the ship moving all on its own?

Yup! Looks like we're headed toward Hollow Bastion.

I wonder what's up.

Uh-oh!

C'mon!

Well, now...took your time, did you?

Oh, was it you who summoned us, Merlin?

Yes, yes... But it seems I used too much power in doing so, and those infernal Heartless...

So, what's up?

Well, I happened to stumble across this in the Zero District.

Pooh's storybook!

That's right. I know you're a good friend of Winnie the Pooh, Sora---that's why I summoned you. And when I did, I was attacked by the Heartless. Of course, I fought back with some rather powerful magic, but then I began to fear the book would be damaged, so I... Oh! Now, just a moment. Leon and the others need to hear this too. I-I'd better go find them. Be back in a jiffy.

I wonder how Pooh's doing.

Wanna find out?

Yeah!

Sora...

Cover for me, okay?

I wonder if Pooh's home.

Hey, Pooh Bear! How you doing? Finding enough honey lately?

Oh, yes. In fact, I was just about to do my stoutness exercises. Would you like to join me, Sora?

Sure, I'm game!

Huh?

Sora! Hurry up!

Donald?

Did ya bring the book, Sora?

Hey!

Give that back!

Think it's okay?

Gawrsh, maybe ya better go back and make sure Pooh's all right.

But what about Merlin?

Well, I guess we could explain...

Great!

Pooh!

I'm so glad you're okay, Pooh.

And I'm glad you came to visit. But you see, I was just about to begin my stoutness exercises. Perhaps we could visit a bit later...Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Oh...sure.

So...how's Piglet these days?

I don't think I know anyone by that name. Now where was I? Oh, yes. My stoutness exercises.

Pooh? Hey! Pooh?

Something very weird is happening here. Maybe I'd better go back and ask Merlin about this.

Couldn't be bothered to wait up for an old wizard, eh?

Sorry about that...

How are things in there?

Well... Pooh seems to have forgotten all about me. And not just me---all his other friends, too.

I was afraid of that...

I suspect it has something to do with those pages the Heartless stole. You'll have to collect the torn pages and repair the book to put things right. This book is one of the world's most cherished elements. I'd been meaning to tell Leon I'd found it, but perhaps we should keep it between us for now.

We will!

Good, good... Now, the book isn't all that's cherished... This is for you, Sora.

What is it?

Simply concentrate on it with all your heart, and you need only say the word to summon an ally who will help in times of need.

Like Simba and Mushu did, the last time we were here?

Precisely. Now go forth, with your friends by your side!

Thanks, Merlin. We're worried about Pooh, so we'll be back once we've found those torn pages.

Huh?

Are ya sure this is the coliseum?

It's that way!

Oh... Guess we were a little off.

Heartless!

Thanks, but...I'm fine.

And you're supposed to be?

I'm Sora, he's Donald, and that's Goofy. We came to see how Hercules is doing.

You know Wonderboy?

Yeah, 'cause we're heroes, too!

Ya mean, junior heroes, Donald.

Looks like we have a friend in common. Name's Megara. My friends call me Meg.

So how's Herc?

Wonderboy? Well, he's duking it out at the Coliseum every day. You know,
and all that. He's ready to drop, but he keeps on fighting. Even Wonderboy has his limits, though. These opponents are bad news---special deliveries from Hades himself...

Hades!?

Right. Lord of the Underworld. I was on my way to see him. Maybe I can get Hades to give Wonderboy a breather. If anything happens to that kid...

Gawrsh... Sounds like you're more than just friends!

Oh...uh, I mean...

We'll go have a little talk with Hades. I'd hate for anything to happen to you on your way to see him.

You really want to do that? Well, it looks like you know what you're doing. I guess I'll take you up on that offer. But...let's keep this whole chat-with-Hades thing our little secret, okay?

Our lips are sealed!

The Organization!

Yeah.

Run! Run away!

Okay...?

Where do they dig these freaks up? Geez, Louise.

Oh, they're nuttin' but trouble, the whole lot of 'em. So, uh...what're you gonna do about Hercules? He's made mince meat outta every fighter you sent at him. Pretty soon the Underworld's gonna be standing room only. Say, why don't you just pick somebody already dead and save him the trouble?

Dead... Dead is good! And I know just the warrior.

I'm scared too, Donald.

Hades, come out!

By the by, uh... What's down there?

Just the Underworld's deepest dungeon. This time I'm bringing out the mother of all bad guys.

You don't say. Well... Maybe I should go.

Let's cut to the chase. Here's the deal I'm gonna offer you. I let you out of the slammer---no strings---you'll be free as a bird.

And all for one little job. Fight Hercules, in the Coliseum...to the death!

This is my story. And you're not part of it.

Did you forget who you're talking to? I am the Lord of the Dead!

No wonder no one wants to die.

You are FIRED!

Hades!

You again?

Fight!


Get up!

Something's wrong!

I feel kinda funny...

That's right! See, that's the thing. In the Underworld, heroes are zeroes---comes with the territory.

Go now!

But I've gotta talk to Hades!

What was that?

We can't fight him here! We have to go---now!

Is he gone?

Don't count on it.

Huh?

Leaving so soon?

You're really good. Are you some kind of hero?

No, I'm no hero... I'm just an...

Huh?

Auron.

My name.

I'm Sora.

Donald.

Goofy!

It seems we were fated to meet. Maybe you need a guardian.

Guardian? Thanks, but no thanks.

I got Heartless all over the Underworld now. So you can leave those pipsqueaks to me. Look, pal, you just keep working on turning Hercules into a Heartless. Then he'll be all mine.

This is my underworld, you idiot!

I'll handle this MYSELF!

Cerberus, go!

What? It's closed!

Come on, open!

Will that open it?

Yeah. I think so.

Hurry!

Uh...

Sora wait!

Come on!

Come on, Wonderboy, play hooky for a day. For old time's sake?

They came to see me. They came to see a hero. I can't let them down.

Don't worry, Meg. I'll be fine. What does a hero need rest for, huh?

See ya!

Sora, don't let me down.

Whew...

Huh?

What happened to Auron?

He can take care of himself. Let's go find Meg. Then we can try this again.

Let me see if I got this right... That brat's Keyblade works on any lock?

That's right.

Have I ever told you about the killer coliseum we have right here in the Underworld? It makes the one upstairs look like an Olympic kiddie pool.

Then that's the place we're gonna put an end to Herc the Jerk's winnin' streak.

Problem. Zeus locked it tight.

Bingo... All we gotta do is swipe that key...and then reopen the Underdrome!

Hate to tell ya, but that key is kinda particular. It won't work for just anybody. And that kid ain't no pushover.

I think this calls for a woman's touch.

Gawrsh, this sure does bring back memories!


Sora! Donald! Goofy! When'd you get here?

Hey, Herc!

Hi!

Howdy there!

You on another adventure?

Yeah, trackin' down some friends, wipin' out some Heartless.

Junior heroes, always busy!

You know it!

So, did you find those friends of yours?

Still working on it. When we got here, we ran into Meg---meg-mega trouble, I mean! So we had to help somebody out. We tried to go teach Hades a thing or two...but the Underworld drains away all our strength. Don't suppose you have any ideas?

Well, there is a stone that guards against the Underworld's curse. The gods on Mount Olympus use it whenever they have to go down there.

Think we could use it?

Sure, why not! I'll go get it for you.

Thanks!

Real nice of you!

But Hades is no pushover, even if you've got the Olympus Stone. And I have a match today, so I can't go with you... Know what you need? Training! Why don't you go talk to Phil?

Hey, good idea!

Hey champ, how ya feeling? Better rest up for tomorrow's match. Nobody's gonna pay to see a worn-out hero...capiche? Remember what I told you. Victory in the games comes down to two simple words Eat, bathe, sleep!

Hey, if it ain't the junior heroes!

Lookin' good, Phil.

Never better! How you guys been? Have you earned your
wings yet?

Nope, you ain't got what it takes.

So, what's up?

Ha ha ha! You three are gonna take on Hades?

What's so funny!?

You got nerve. I like that. Hey, you never know---stranger things have happened, right? Better get cracking, boys! So you want to train, eh? All right, I'm gonna work you hard!

How was THAT?

It ain't over yet, kid! There's more on the menu. You can relax once you've finished ALL the training.

No problem!

Now get ready for the real thing. If a big one appears, don't let it get away.

Listen, I gotta take off for a bit.

Where to?

None of your beeswax.

Sorry, guys... The Olympus Stone has been stolen.

What!?

By who?

We don't know who did it yet. All we're sure of is that it was a guy in a black-hooded cloak. And he had accomplices---a bunch of creatures in white.

Someone you know?

I think so. Hey, if we can get the Olympus Stone back, can we borrow it for a while?

Sure. By the way, you haven't seen Meg around, have you?

Oh, okay...

What's wrong, your hero-ness? Feeling under the weather?

You know, I though staying in perfect shape was part of the hero job description...you know what I'm saying?

Oh, right... Hades, we gotta talk!

I came to share a bit of mildly-interesting news

Seems your dear, sweet little Nutmeg...

...went and got herself lost in the Underworld.

You mean you kidnapped her!

Well, maybe... But why get caught up in the details?

Uh-uh-uh! You can't leave now, okay?

You've got a very important match today, against, um... the bloodthirsty Hydra! I mean, if you don't stick around, who knows what kind of
might happen.

Yeah, accidents you cause.

Like I said details, who needs 'em?

You're just a coward.

Ah well. Can't all be heroes.

Can you handle this?

You got it! We're heroes!

Junior heroes, Donald.

You take care of the Hydra. We'll handle the rest.

I'm counting on you.

You gotta find Meg!

Phil!

Ooh, ohh...

What happened?

I spotted this strange guy all dressed in black. I chased after him, but he turned on me. Next thing I know, I'm seeing stars.

All dressed in black!?

He's the one who stole the Olympus Stone.

Where did he run off to?

To the Underworld. He's a bad apple, all right. And all I wanted was to find a backup hero. Just in case Herc needed to take a break.

Heroes, eh? You could've just asked!

You know someone!?

Oh, good one...

Hercules! Hercules! Hercules!

Heh, thanks! Thank you! Hope you enjoyed it!

Man... This Underworld curse is really getting to me.

We've got to get that Olympus Stone back fast!

Huh? Ah! You!

Wait a sec... Roxas?

Excuse me?

Roxas? Oh, it's no use.

Huh? What are you talking about?

Let's see, here...
... Right. Did they ever pick the wrong guy for this one...

You're bizarre...

He's gotta be the thief!

Now that's just plain rude!

Dance, water! Dance!

Not bad, Roxas!

Roxas, come back to us!

Guy's a broken record.

Hey, look!

Let's go! Meg needs our help!

Meg!

Almost there.

Now that's what I call a key. Gee, thanks for your help! Now have a nice day.

Sora, behind you!

What's wrong? Can't fight in the Underworld? Ohh, boo-hoo-hoo!

Better think again!

Charge!

There's too many!

Let's go!

Sorry I'm late.

Get Meg outta here. I'll meet you back at the Coliseum.

What about you?

I'm gonna show these guys what happens when they mess with a true hero.

Now, wait a sec!

Sora...I won't leave him.

He'll be okay.

Look, even Herc has his limits. He can't keep winning forever.

Then we'll go back him up.

Get Meg outta here!

This place gives me the creeps. I'll deal with you nitwits next time!

Could today possibly get any better? This time Wonder-breath is going down for good.

Well, if it isn't everyone's favorite hero washout. You really blew it this time.

No one likes a sore loser, Hades.

Can it, keyboy!

Then let me.

No one likes a sore loser, Hades.

Yeah, yeah, Styx and stones. Hey, maybe you should go check on that Hydra you neglected to finish off. I hear things are really FALLING APART up there, champ.

Wait!

Hate to run, but I've got another little diversion to attend to.

This can't be...

Champ! You're safe!

I failed...

It's not your fault!

I left everyone unprotected.

Hades was right. I'm just a...a washout.

Aw, come on, champ! I didn't train you to think like that.

Wonderboy...

Phil's right. This is no time to beat yourself up.

I'm some hero...

Herc needs help!

Yeah!

Don't suppose you got room for one more?

We're in!

I let you down. I'm just...no use.

It's not your fault. Hey, even a god would be exhausted.

She's right. Give yourself a chance to rest.

There won't be any games for a while, anyway.

Don't worry about Wonderboy here. I'll look after him. Sora, Donald, Goofy, I owe you big time.

Hey, it's no big deal. Just let us know if Hades or the Heartless start acting up. We'll take care of it.

Yeah, that's what heroes are for!

When did you three make hero?

Let's save that for another time... We have to hit the road.

Okay. Don't be strangers.

Gawrsh, I hope ya feel better soon, Hercules.

Yeah...

Phil?

Oh, well, take care you guys! Stay a little longer next time. We got some serious training to catch up on.

Well, time to go. Oh, I almost forgot. The Olympus Stone.

And where is everyone else?

Beats me. They musta had some other matters to deal with.


?

You mean they have more important affairs to attend to than my return?

Well, see, there's this Organization XIII that keeps gettin' in the way---

Let those fools play their little game!

But what about that runt with the Keyblade? He's been a real pain, too.

Oh, has he? Very well then. I suppose you'd best tell me what's happened during my absence.

Oh...hmm. Now I wonder where that old album could be.

Queen Minnie!

It's horrible!

Somethin's wrong in the Hall of the Cornerstone!

There's real sharp thorns everywhere!

Oh, King Mickey, I wish you could hear me. The castle is in danger! We've got to do something soon! Donald... Goofy... Where are you?

This is your castle... Must be nice to be home, huh? Well...

Ya know, somethin' just don't feel quite right...

Yeah.

You're back!

Move it! Let's go!

Queen Minnie needs to see you!

The castle's in danger! Hurry! To the library!

Your Majesty! Queen Minnie! We're back!

You're here!

Your Royal Highness, did ya happen to summon us?

Yes.

Where's the King?

Excuse him. This is our friend, Sora.

Oh, Sora! The King told me all about you in his letters. He said you're a very brave young man.

So, do you know where he is?

Your Majesty, what are Heartless doing in your castle?

Oh my... So those are the Heartless.

Don't worry, we'll take care of 'em!

I know I can count on you, Sora. Now, there's something I'd like all of you to come and see. Would you please escort me to the audience chamber?

I forgot to warn everyone else in the castle about the danger! We must be sure they're hidden somewhere safe!

Okay, we'll go tell them!

The whole castle!?

We just gotta split up, Donald.

I'll make sure that everyone knows what's going on.

No, Sora, you'll just get lost!

Okay. Then I'll stay with the Queen.

Good.

All righty then, see ya later!

Um, the audience chamber, right, ma'am?

Yes, Sora. Let's be on our way.

Just one moment.

As soon as the trouble started, I made sure to seal this room.

Now then...shall we?

Not here, too!

I got 'em.

Come on, gimme a break!

Huh?

Whoa...

The room below is called the 'Hall of the Cornerstone.' Our castle has always been safe from worlds that are evil...thanks to the Cornerstone of Light which we keep down there.

The Cornerstone...of light?

This is the castle's cherished Cornerstone. But look. The thorns... They must be the work of someone very evil. I wonder what this could mean...

Maleficent!

No way!

Well, well, well. What have we here...? If it isn't the wretched Keyblade holder, and his pitiful lackeys!

What!? Now you're gonna deal with me!

All in good time. I promise you'll be able to partake of my vengeance. But you must be patient.

Just what are you doing here, Maleficent!?

Ah, Queen Minnie. Radiant, as always.

I'm here on a property venture. I want this castle for my own. However, it's a bit too
for what I have in mind. I suppose I'll just have to fill every room with my personal touch of darkness.

You'd better stop right now if you know what's good for you!

Ooh, how frightening. Very well. I'll stop... Just as soon as the castle belongs to me!

What a hag.

Nothing like this has ever happened before. I looked through all the records in the library, but I couldn't find a single clue.

Ohhh! We should go ask somebody who knows lotsa stuff that ain't in any book!

Merlin the Wizard!

Yes! That's perfect! Merlin just might know something about this mess. Let's ask his advice!

We saw him in Hollow Bastion, right?

Yeah. Let's go!

Anybody home?

Merlin!

The castle's in danger!

What is all that racket? Ho-ho! I thought---oh, it's you! It looks like you've learned a bit since the last time I saw you.

Really!?

Wait a minute! Let's talk about the problem! It's Maleficent! She's back!

Where? Inside the castle!?

Yep! And Heartless, too.

Oh, dear...

Maleficent wants to take over the whole castle...

There's Heartless in every part of the castle! The Queen is in danger! What!?

Perhaps, I'd better just see for myself.

Mm-hmm...interesting...

What's happening, Merlin?

This is not good. In fact, I'm afraid, it's quite serious.

What's that?

My boy, that is a gateway to a special world. Someone in that world is responsible for what's going on in this castle. Of that, I'm certain.

Oh boy!

We knew we could count on you, Merlin!

Then we should go get him!

Wait a moment! The perpetrators must be stopped, of course. But there's something else to do first. Somewhere in that world, there should be another door that's identical to this one. I believe our enemies are utilizing that door. As long as it remains open, the castle will be in grave danger. Listen carefully, Sora. You must find that door. And when you do---lock it with your Keyblade.

Got it.

You can count on us!

Now, one more thing. You're heading into a very special world. While you're there, the nature of that world may tempt you to do something dark. You must resist that temptation at all costs!

What do you mean?

You'll know soon enough. I have faith in you, my lads!

Hey, look! There's the Cornerstone of Light!

What's going on? Everything's black and white.

Hey, this is kinda like...um...uh...

Deja vu?

Yeah, that's it!

Really? Have you been here before?

Hey you! Seen any bad guys around here?

Why I oughta... Bah! I don't have time to waste on punks like you! So, I guess I'll go easy on ya!

Well, there's our villain.

What's with you squirts? You got some kinda bone to pick with me?

More than one!

Them's fighting words!

Huh?

Not so fast!

Yeah!

What's that for?

What's you punks' beef with me anyway? Hmm... Who are ya? You new around here?

Cut the act.

Whoa!

Ooh, ow!

You know, somethin' doesn't seem quite right here. Are you sure you're Pete?

Well, of COURSE I'm Pete. I'm the captain of the steamboat. So stop botherin' me, see?

So hit the road! I gotta go find the little runt what stole my boat!

Gawrsh, maybe we made a mistake.

I'm starting to think the same thing. He hasn't even called any Heartless.

Sorry we attacked ya like that, Capt'n Pete.

Oh yeah? Well, if you're really sorry, then go find my steamboat.

Y-yes sir!

Ooh, my achin' back.

I thought for sure Pete was the bad guy.

Aw, that would be too easy.

C'mon, fellas. Let's try to find that steamboat.

I guess we DID say we would...

Hey, we've got a door to find!

Oh, yeah!

I don't see any doors.

Huh? What's this?

I can't see a thing...

Hey, look! There's the Cornerstone of Light!

What's going on? Everything's black and white.

Hey, this is kinda like...um...uh...

Deja vu?

Yeah, that's it!

Really? Have you been here before?

What was that?

Heartless goin' out...

...and us, coming in.

What does it mean?

Let's get rid of those Heartless!

Then what'll we do?

We'll worry about that later!

What're they building?

Look out!

The King!

Gee, he seems kinda different somehow...

Heartless! I knew it! You really saved the day!

Now, let's get those Heartless!

How'd you like that?

Hey, look!

You absolute idiot! You've managed to fail at everything! And what's more...you foolishly thought you could take my place while I was away. Well, as of now, you're finished. Mark my words, there'll be no place for you when our time comes!

Useless imbecile...

But-but...but I...

What---?

Somebody sure was angry.

I don't understand.

Let's just try to clear out the Heartless first. This place is okay, but we've got three more spots to check.

What!?

The town's shrunk!

Or do ya think maybe we got bigger?

Hey! Look at the toy cannons!

What's he saying?

Hey! There're Heartless!

Man, that was weird!

Look, Sora! Over there!

Aw, for cryin' out loud...she didn't have to go and say that. Okay, I mighta messed up every now and then. But I'm a lot more things than useless... Why, when I was startin' out...

Oh...I miss those good ol' days... What I wouldn't give to go back in time...
What I wouldn't give...

Huh?

Hey! I think that's my...

A door?

It looks familiar...

Yup---it's the door Merlin magic'd up!

So it should come straight here, right?

Sure! I think...

Let's check it out!

Fire!

C'mon, he needs our help!

Majesty!

Well, that takes care of that!

Hey!

Fascinating... This appears to be a portal to the past!

Yeah, it was the strangest thing!

Stop gawking! And start thinking of a way we can use it to our advantage!

Okay.

Now, perhaps I could give you one more chance to redeem yourself.

Oh, thank you, thank you! You can count on me...! So, what do I do?

Patience, my dear...

What have we here? Well, if it isn't the Cornerstone of Light... Mmm... Now we can take the castle from those fools---but we'll have to proceed with the utmost of care...

Maleficent!

She must have known all along!

Let's see...if that door's connected to the past...

No, no, no! It comes here.

Huh?

Then that means we're in the past!

Wow. If we're in the past...

...we can change the future!

Hold on, fellas! Remember what Merlin said? He's got faith in us. And we have to resist temptation no matter what!

Aw, I was only joking.

Who'd want to change the future, anyway? So...what are we gonna do?

Doors, bad guys... Gawrsh, my brain hurts!

Well, we know we're on the right track!

C'mon! He needs our help!

Whew!

Huh?

Listen well.

On the other side of this portal, they're about to begin construction on that wretched castle. But until then, their treasured Cornerstone of Light lies unguarded, with all of its power still contained!

The Cornerstone...of Light?

Yes! That cursed sphere is the very thing that prevents us from entering the castle.

Oh.

You know what must be done?

Uh...

Go then. Time to prove your worth! And don't dare to fail me again!

Don't fail her again...let's see...

That's it! I just gotta smash that Cornerstone to smithereens!

But first... I gotta go get my old boat back.

It was Pete after all!

Why, he tricked us!

Still, something doesn't seem right.

Hmm... The Pete we met here had kind of an attitude, but he didn't seem like a bad guy...

Look!

Now that castle's as good as ours!

That's the Pete we know!

Bad, bad, bad!

Oh, no!

The Cornerstone's gone!

But that means...

They're gonna fill the castle with darkness! We gotta hurry!

Hey, hold it right there!

No way, small fry! I finally found the pipsqueak what stole my steamboat!

Yeah! It was you!

Right, me!
No! No! It wasn't me! It's just somebody who looks like me!

Aw, which is it!?

Waaaait!

Shuddup!

Your future's on the line, pallie, so back off and give me the boat!

The Cornerstone!

After him!

You mugs couldn't follow me if you wanted to!

Later, losers!

I'll show you!

Oooh, I can't take anymore...

Yes!

You'll pay for this!

It's the Cornerstone!

Donald, we'll come back for it later!

Pete's headin' for the doorway!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

Ha! You're still wet behind the ears!

Then try us!

It serves ya right!

Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

The door!

Yeah...Annnd stay out!

Sora!

Yeah, I know!

Would somebody tell me what's been goin' on here? Who was that creep, anyways?

Hello? That creep was you from the future!

Sora, that's a secret!

Secret? What kinda secret? Oh, never mind. Sorry I put you guys through all that trouble.

Yeah, well, just don't make a habit out of it!

And to show ya my appreciation, I'll let you pilot my steamboat. Best little craft on the river! My deck hand Mickey's late anyways.

I betcha the castle's safe now.

Guess we should head back.

Wait! As long as we're here...

Donald!

Huh? What? No, no, no!

Hey! What's the big idea!? Let me go! Let me GO!

The thorns have disappeared!

By george! The lads have accomplished their mission.

Hooray!

Let's have an acorn feast to celebrate!

Welcome back! Because of your bravery, the castle is safe and protected again. Thank you so much for all you've done!

Good work, you guys!

Now boys, I hope you didn't do anything reckless while you were there?

Of course not!

Daisy!

Daisy, I'm back!

Who?

Daisy is Donald's very special sweetheart.

Really...

Donald, you forgot about our date again! You'd better have a good excuse this time!

But Daisy...I...

I know it's an important mission, but you could at least check in every once in a while.

Sora!

Donald!

Just be a minute...

Going somewhere?

Of course not!

Donald!

Oh, look!

Daisy, we need Donald for just a little longer.

How much longer?

Um, well...

I'll be back soon, Daisy!

Don't you worry, Queen Minnie. We'll return.

Please tell the King that we're still looking for him!

I will!

See you soon!

Think wisely!

Ah, the night sky is so beautiful right after a storm...

What would I give to live where you are... What would I pay to stay here beside you... What would I do to see you smiling at me... Where would we walk, where would we run if we could stay all day in the sun... Just you and me, and I could be part of your world...

The girl who rescued me...Her voice...

Oh boy! Under the sea again!

Uh-huh!

Whoa!

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Uh...hi there!

You forget how to swim already?

Kinda, I guess.

Den you boys got to practice! You follow Flounder---he show you what to do.

C'mon, Sora, you can do it!

Yes, that's it! You're a quick learner, Sora!

That's much better!

Now den... What brings you three into de sea? Is somethin' going on?

Kind of.

But everything SEEMS peaceful.

Oh, everything's fine...as long as Daddy's in a good mood.

Hey, we got us a concert very soon. Why don't you sing in my musical extravaganza? Please say yes! Ariel's been actin' strange lately. But she might settle down and practice if you're dere, too.

That sounds fun!

Let's give it a shot!

Excellent! Now den, I teach you everything you need.

Er, what do we have to do?

It's easy! All you gotta do is feel de rhythm! Hear de beat and put a little shake in it! Ready? Let's go!

Dat's it! Okay, Donald. Your turn. You do it just like Sora. Den he see what you got.

Dat's it! Goofy, it's you, now. You think you can do better?

Dat's it! Dis time you gonna dance with Ariel! Remember, don't miss de beat!

Dat's it! Now we jammin' with de bubbles! De rules is de same---you gotta stick to de beat.

Dat's right! You got it! Dat's all dere is to it.

Gawrsh, I don't know...

Any time you wanna sing in a music masterpiece you just come see me.

Sure, I'll give it a try!

Break a fin!

Here goes nothing!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now.

It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

Let the music move you! You can do it!

Don't be shy, let the music inside. And dance, dance, dance!

See, you can do it!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now. It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

Watch the stage, now! How exciting!

See the sign? Can you reach it in time? And tap, tap, tap?

Yeah, that's it, mon!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now. It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

And if you can't reach the target, use magic!

It's all the same, if you've got steady aim. Just zap, zap, zap!

There, you got the rhythm now!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now.

It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

It's not over yet! You can do it---keep going!

Drum solo! Here's the sign. Give him the cue!


Count him in so he'll know to begin to drum, drum, drum!

Now the cues are up to you.

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now.

It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

Here's your big moment! Make 'em cheer!

Don't dilly-dally, it's your big finale! Sha-la-la!

You made quite a splash! That was fantastic!

Swim this way, we'll dance and we'll play now. It's very easy, come on in! Just take a chance and shake a fin!

Swim along, just join in the song. A musical for everyone to have a lot of finny fun.

Sora, you were amazing!

Hey! I wanna sing more lines!

Your Majesty! We have visitors!

King Triton!

I certainly hope there hasn't been a need to use that Keyblade of yours.

Nope. Everything's fine. Not a Heartless in sight.

Your Majesty, our guests, dey wanna sing in de musical.

Well, that sounds like a splendid idea. We may need your help after all... You see, I'm afraid Ariel's still infatuated with the human world. A busy rehearsal schedule might be just the thing she needs to stop thinking about life up on the surface.

Swim along, just join in the song. A musical for everyone to have a lot of finny fun.

That's the voice I heard! I'm sure of it!

Hello!? Where are you hiding? I know you're the girl who saved me. Please, come out so I can thank you.

Ariel?
Dat girl's acting strange again. Probably been flittin' around on da surface... Ohhh, da Sea King's gonna have my claws for dis!

C'mon, we gotta keep rehearsing!

I'm sorry, but I don't feel like it.

No! Ariel!

I've got an idea, Sebastian.

You do?

I know how to cheer Ariel up! C'mon, follow me!

Over here!

See...

Oh, no! Dis must be from de human world!

I found it after that storm--- And I bet it's from a shipwreck. Don't ya think Ariel's gonna love it?

But if de Sea King finds out about dis...

It's better than going to the surface!

C'mon, help me move it.

It's no use.

Ariel!

We'd like you to come with us, Ariel.

Have we got something to show you!

It's a pretty cool statue, huh?

It looks like some kinda prince.

A prince!?

Look at this stuff, isn't it neat? Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?

Wouldn't you think I'm the girl... The girl who has everything?

Look at this trove, treasures untold. How many wonders can one cavern hold? Looking around here you'd think...




I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty. I've got whozits and whatzits galore.

You want thingamabobs? I got twenty.

But who cares? No big deal.

I want more.

I wanna be where the people are. I wanna see... wanna see 'em dancing.

Walking around on those...

What do you call 'em?

Oh,


Up where they walk, up where they run...

Up where they stay all day in the sun...

Wandering free, wish I could be... Part of that world.

Ariel... We're here to help you, you know.

Oh, no---you three stay out of it!

Look who's talking!

Yeah! You were gonna tell her dad about it!

What am I going to do?

You're late, Sebastian. Is something wrong?

No. Nothing, Your Majesty.

That's good. So, tell me---how is the song for the musical coming?

It is finished, Your Majesty! And it celebrates all de wonderful things found here in de ocean. It will be my finest work.

Will it get Ariel's mind off the human world?

Er, yes...well... Probably... Possibly...

I-I mean, most definitely! Excuse me, Your Majesty, but I must rehearse...you understand.

This is terrible! We've got to do something.

She can't be in the musical like that.

I'll sing her part instead!

No way! Not a chance!

What? Why not!?

Hey, it's Sebastian.

Dis will never work...

What's up?

I've composed a perfect song for de musical, but I think it's gonna be too complicated for you.

Aw, c'mon! How hard can it be?

Uh-oh...

The seaweed is always greener in somebody else's lake.

You dream about going up there... But that is a big mistake.

Just look at the world around you, right here on the ocean floor.


Such wonderful things surround you. What more is you looking for?

Under the sea. Under the sea.

Darling, it's better down where it's wetter. Take it from me.

Up on the shore they work all day. Out in the sun they slave away...

While we devoting full time to floating... Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea!

Under the sea.

Under the sea!

Since life is sweet here, we got the beat here, naturally!

Naturally-y-y!

Even the sturgeon and the ray.

They get the urge and start to play.

We got the spirit, you got to hear it... Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

Under the sea.

When the sardine begin the beguine, it's music to me.

What do they got? A lot of sand.

We got a hot crustacean band.

Eat little clam here, know how to jam here...

Under the sea.

Each little slug here, cutting a rug here, under the sea.

Each little snail here, know how to wail here.

That's why it's hotter...

Under the water.

Ya we in luck here, down in the muck here.

Under the sea.

So what do you think, Ariel?

Oh, I think it's a great song, Sebastian. It's just... it's not what I wanna sing.

I wanna sing about...how our two worlds can live in harmony---land and sea together!

De Sea King would make chowder outta me if you sang a song like dat!

If you won't listen, then I'm not going to sing at all.

A-Ariel!

Hmph! How do I get myself into dese situations? Ohh, man. Not only has dat girl fallen in love at da worst possible time, but wid a human!

Ariel's in love with a human!?

Ohh, me and my big mouth...

Oh!

Is that him?

Uh-huh.

Let's say something!

No, don't! He's a human and I'm a mermaid. I...I don't know what he'd think.

What's that?

Oh! It must be his!

But we can't reach it...

Rats!

This is great, Sora. I know he'll be happy to have this back.

And just who is this
?

Daddy!

Ariel, you know how dangerous humans are!

You don't even know him! Oh, Daddy, you've told me that you don't trust humans. But they can't ALL be as bad as you say. And I'm---well, I'm going to prove it to you.

So help me Ariel, I am going to get through to you.

And if this is the only way...

So be it.

Ariel, you poor child!

You're Ursula---the sea witch! Didn't my father banish you?

That's right, angelfish. But how could I stay away, when I knew you were so miserable? What you need is a woman's advice.

What if I could make all your dreams come true?

My father would never allow it...

Oh, well. It mustn't be love, if you give up that easily.

Could...could you really help me? But how?

Well...the only way to get what you want is to become a human yourself.

A human? Can you do that?

My dear, sweet child...that's what I do.

Dis is terrible! Flounder! You gotta go tell de King!

Okay!

Have we got a deal? I'll turn you into a human right now. All you have to do is sign a little contract.

A contract?

That's right, sweetcakes. And the price is just a token. A trifle. What I want from you is...your voice.

M-my voice?

I almost forgot---the magic only lasts for three days. You've got to get dear old Princie to kiss you before the sun sets on the third day. If he doesn't, you turn back into a mermaid, and belong to me! I suppose you might find my terms a little tough. After all, you ARE King Triton's daughter. Adored by all of a Atlantica! Why, you're practically guaranteed a happy life. Are you sure you won't listen to your daddy? All it'll cost you is your true love. Come on, sweetie pie. This is your last chance. But far be it from little old me to twist your arm.

Don't listen to her, Ariel!

Well, now. I won't intrude any longer. I'll be on my way. You obviously don't want my help. Too bad about your prince, though. He IS quite a catch...

Wait!

All I have to do is sign?

We have a deal! Here you go!

Ariel! Don't!

Sora, please! You got to stop her, mon!

Wait!

Oh, no! She can't breathe like that!

Are you the girl? Please wake up!

Whoa, easy there!

What's wrong? You can't speak? Oh... Well, where did you come from?

That's my pendant!

I-I can't believe you found it.

Thank you.

Please. Come with me. I want to help you.

Looks like it's going pretty well!

Gawrsh, shouldn't we tell King Triton about this?

Absolutely not! It would break his heart if he found out about dis!

Then what do we do?

We gonna stay right here and take care of Ariel. Dat's what we gonna do.

I guess that's all we CAN do.

So we just float here and watch?

Have you got a better idea?

We could make Ursula fix all of this.

Hah! She ain't gonna bother wid you.

Hey, you never know until you try!

Hmm... You may be right. It's gotta be better dan doing nothin'. Can I trust you to take care of Ursula?

Of course!

Hey! Where's Sebastian?

Uhh...oh...well... King Triton wanted him at the palace.

I wonder if it's about Ariel.

If King Triton finds out what happened, we're in hot water. Especially since we kept it a secret.

What about Ursula?

She disappeared.

Well, how's Ariel doing? She's only got until sunset tomorrow, right?

Hey, look!

I can't see!

They're okay!

Man... they were so close.

Well, I think we oughta get back to lookin' for Ursula.

Yeah, good idea.

No sign of Ursula anywhere...

I wonder where that sea witch coulda gone.

Ariel's been crying for a long time.

What would I give to live where you are? What would I pay to stay here beside you? What would I do to see you smiling at me?

Where would we walk? Where would we run? If we could stay all day in the sun...

Hey, what's up with the Prince?

Just you and me, and I could be...

Look! There!

Part of your world.

It's Ursula! She...she must've turned herself into that girl!

Okay, that's it!

What...what happened?

Eric!

You...you can talk... You're the one... The girl who sang to me.

Oh, Eric, I wanted to tell you.

Of course! It was you! You're the one who...who saved me that night in the storm! Oh, Ariel. I'm sorry I didn't figure it out sooner. You're the one I love.

Eric...

Not so fast!

Do you see what I see?

You're too late!

Ariel!

Stop!

Stay out of this, you fools!

Triton's precious little daughter signed a contract! Now, dearie...let's see how beautiful you are when I'm through with you!

That contract's no good!

Let her go!

Excuse me!?

Now, now---even the great King Triton can't go around breaking binding contracts. Why, it just wouldn't do, would it? Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some loose ends to tie up.

Wait, Ursula... You win. Just promise you'll let my daughter go.

But we had a deal---unless, of course, you're offering to take her place?

I'm afraid...I have no choice.

Your Majesty!

At last!

Daddy!

Who's the
of the seas now?

You---you monster! Let him go!

Eric!

How dare you! Pitiful, insignificant human!

Hey! That's enough!

Ha ha! Now you all bow to me!

This witch is back to bring her wrath upon the sea. Triton can't be rid of me, not that easily.

And like all who dare defy me, he will learn his lesson well Never toy with a girl like me.

You got what you deserved!

Flotsam and Jetsam!

Loyal darlings, strong as the tide. Sweetest poopsies, hasten to my side.

Right now! Mommy needs you.

Crush those stupid fools, make them writhe!

All right!

What a feeble human. No, I can't believe my eyes.

Such a stubborn royal who is fighting for his prize.

Without your precious mermaid, now you're crazy with revenge. I suppose I sympathize.

I'm not gonna lose her!

Right! We're with you all the way!

Flotsam and Jetsam! Loyal darlings, strong as the tide.

Sweetest poopsies, hasten to my side.

Right now! Mommy needs you. Smash those stupid fools, make them writhe!

Sorry,
... Your poopsies are toast!

This is not the end, my dears, I swear I've just begun. It's not over until Ursula has won!

That's what you think!

No...it's not possible!

It's over, Ursula!

That belongs to me!

All right, then---you can have it!

Please, Ariel... You can come out now---it's okay.

Ariel?

You see, Eric...this is why I went to Ursula.

This can't be...

I would have told you sooner...

To think...

Eric...goodbye.

I had all that time and I didn't work on my swimming.

Well, I guess it's never too late to learn, right? Will ya teach me?

I'd love to!

All right!

Prince Eric's a great guy---and he's really brave, too.

Yes. But he IS a human.

Oh brother. Not again...

How'd it go with your father, Ariel?

Great! Thanks for your help. I gotta go. I'll see you later!

Hey, wait...

I almost forgot, Sebastian! King Triton said this year's festival is so important that the music better be your best ever!

My best ever? Hmm...

All right, what's going on?

You gotta do me a favor.

What?

Huh?

But how?

And it was gonna make de perfect song, too...

Looks like you can handle dis now! Now our musical will be perfect! This is it. Are you ready to start?

I'm ready! Let's do it!

Welcome the dawning of a happy age of new beginnings.

Land and see have come together, joined in peace and harmony. Fairy tales and miracles are what we're singing of.

Our dear princess, Ariel, truly fell in love. With a prince, a human prince, who lived so far above.

Wishes really can come true, if you want them to.

And this happiness inside, I owe to ev'ry one of you.

How about you introduce us to these lovely friend of yours?

Come take a bow Donald, Goofy, and Sora.

Congratulations, dear princess, to you...

You found your first love and he found you, too.

We were glad to help you out, and very proud, it's true.

Seeing how we made you grin just makes us want to twirl a fin.

Wishes really can come true, if you want them to. And this happiness inside, I owe to ev'ry one of you.

Be so kind to introduce the King, and these his loyal friends.

Please say hello Daddy, Sebastian, Flounder.

Ariel, I'm so happy for you.

Yes, happy endings are so rare and so few.

We were glad to help, and very proud, it's true.

Seeing how we made you grin just makes us want to twirl a fin.

Any other friends of yours that might be waiting in the wings?

Come say hello All my friends from ev'ry corner of the world.

A new day is dawning on a happy age of new beginnings.

Land and see have come together, joined in peace and harmony.

Fairy tales and miracles are what we're singing of.

Our dear princess, Ariel, Prince Eric from above. A happy end forever after, full of joy and love.

Sora, what's happening?

A new pathway has opened.

What? You gonna go? Dis is goodbye?

I won't do it! We'll never say goodbye!

That's right! A-one, two, three, four

Even though we're hittin' the road, our worlds are all connected.

Which means...

We are free to come and go.

And sing!

So don't be sad, and always know, we'll come back soon to say hello!

Wow!

This place is...

Kinda different.

Something's up!

Organization XIII?

Or the Heartless!

Only one way to find out.

Aztec treasure, eh?

Aye! And thanks to the curse put on it, we are neither among the livin' nor the dead.

Really? 'Cause ya look like regular pirates to me.

Ah, but in the moonlight...

Whoa! Now I get what you were sayin'... Well, if you see two doofuses and a brat holdin' a Keyblade, steer clear. They got a kinda magic that don't belong in this world, see? And nobody knows what it'd do to ya. 'Specially when the moon's showing whatcha really are.

A match for Barbossa, you say?

Hey!

See there? I knew it! Those are the punks I was tellin' ya about.

Who are you calling punks? It's Sora, Donald, and Goofy to you! And don't you forget it!

That we won't. And we'll engrave it on your tombstone, to be sure.

Whoa! I like your style.

Men---half of you stay here and indulge these cullies. The rest---bring me that medallion!

Aye!

Aw, we only get to stomp on a few of you?

It's no use! We can't beat them!

Aye, whaddya expect?

You'd best be sayin' your prayers!

Hey, watch out! They can see ya! Stay away from their magic!

What for?

Weren't you listenin' to me before?

Hey, Pete, thanks for the tip!

Hey! This ain't over!

If Pete's here, that must mean we have work to do.

Yep. And that pirate captain looked pretty mean, too.

Man, I'd hate to see him turn into a Heartless.

Well, we ARE here...

Hey, maybe we can take a pirate ship out for a spin!

Just kidding! Weren't those guys headed into town?

Yeah. I think they were looking for treasure.

Where are you taking me!? Let me go!

Elizabeth!

Stop!

What are they?

It's the Heartless! Watch out!

We'll deal with them! Go! Take cover!

Well done! My own fencing skills are not to be ashamed of...but I've never faced foes such as that before.

You really think we're that good?

Did you find your friend?

I was too late. But I must rescue her! Would you help me?

Of course! I'm Sora. This is Donald and Goofy.

And I'm William Turner, but call me Will.

Okay, Will. Let's go!

Right. We've got to get to the docks!

We're too late!

Huh?

Those pirates kidnapped Miss Swann and took her to their ship. Now they've sailed, and I'll never be able to find her!

Then she's long gone. The Black Pearl is nigh uncatchable. Best find yourself another girl, mate.

You... What are you doing aboard the Interceptor? She's off limits to civilians.

Ah, fortunate that I'm going to commandeer her, then. She'll make a fine pirate ship.

A pirate!

Captain Jack Sparrow, if you please.

Take me with you. Help me hunt down the Black Pearl and save Miss Swann. I got you out of that jail cell, Sparrow. Do this and your debt's repaid.

You'll have to win fair lady's heart alone, mate. I see no profit in it for me.

C'mon, Captain!

Are you sure you can sail her, all on your own?

You've a point there.

Thanks, Sparrow.

CAPTAIN Sparrow.

I'm Sora. This is Donald and Goofy.

I'm Will Turner.

That would be short for William, I imagine. No doubt named for your father, eh?

Yes.

Well, then, Mr. Turner. You get us ready to make way. I've some effects to liberate.

Aye-aye! But hurry.

Naturally.

Sora!

You really wanna be a pirate?

Of course not!

What do you make of this Will?

I don't know. We just met him.

Hmm... I think my luck's about to change.

You can release me. You have your trinket; I'm of no further value to you.

This is no trinket, missy. This is cursed Aztec gold. One of eight hundred and eighty-two identical pieces they delivered in a stone chest to Cortez himself.

I hardly believe in ghost stories anymore, Captain Barbossa.

That's exactly what I thought. Buried on an Island of Dead what cannot be found 'cept for those who know where it is. Find it, we did. There be the chest. Inside be the gold. And we took 'em all! We spent 'em and traded 'em and frittered 'em away on drink and food and pleasurable company.

The more we gave 'em away, the more we came to realize... the drink would not satisfy, and food turned to ash in our mouths. We are cursed men, Miss Turner. Compelled by greed, we were, but now... we are consumed by it.

How very sad for you.

There is one way we can end our curse. All the scattered pieces of the Aztec gold must be gathered and restored to the stone chest. And the blood of every soul who touched a piece o' the treasure must be repaid.

Miss Turner! For ten years we've searched every league of these waters, every town and village---preying on sailors and settlers alike! Eight hundred and eighty-one pieces we found, but despaired of ever finding the last. All those years, you been safe in your bed, readin' your pirate stories, dreamin' of adventure on the high seas---we've endured torments worse than death itself!

But now, thanks to ye, we have the final piece---at last. When this medallion is restored to the chest, we'll be free to roam the seas as men. No longer will we be ghosts!

And the blood that's to be repaid?

That's why there's no sense to be killin' ye...yet.

Ye see, the moonlight shows us for what we really are.

We are not among the livin', and so we cannot die. But neither are we dead. I've suffered too long! You'd best start believin' in ghost stories, Miss Turner. For, you see, tonight---you're in one!

Why are you so fixated on that compass?

It'll be she that leads us to the Isla de Muerta---where Barbossa's headed. Savvy?

How do you know?

Ah, lad... He and I once had our eyes on a treasure---Aztec gold. 'Twas hidden on the Isla de Muerta. But he turned traitor and stole my ship.

So he's after that treasure, then.

Treasure's already his. So's the curse upon it. I've no desire for such treacherous spoils. But I will have back what's mine---the Black Pearl.

You lads wait here. Young Turner and I will rescue the lady.

Hey! What about us?

You're to guard the ship, o' course. It's a task given only to the bravest of pirates.

All right...

Guard her well!

Shall we?

I think he was just trying to fast-talk us...

And you fell for it.

What's keeping those two?

They sure are taking their time...

If Pete's hanging around, there must be Heartless here, too. And Jack and Will aren't used to fighting Heartless... Let's go see.

Every last piece that went astray we have returned, save for this! And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever!

Quick, they're after us!

We'll hold them off! Give us a sign when the ship's ready to sail!

Right! We'll light the signal flare!

The signal!

Where's Jack?

Well...

And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever!

No! Not yet. We wait for the opportune moment.

When it's of greatest profit to you?

May I ask you something?

Have I ever given you reason not to trust me? Stay here...and try not to do anything stupid.

Begun by blood...by blood undone.

You! Maid! Your father. Was your father William Turner!?

No.

I don't understand!

What's going on?

Who brought this wench to us?

She said her name was Turner!

Come on!

Why isn't it working?

Get on with it!

Hurry!

You there! The medallion! After them, you ingrates!

I had to. Jack's no fairy-tale pirate. The real ones aren't to be trusted.

Is it true? You gave Barbossa my name instead of yours. Why choose my name?

I don't know.

Elizabeth...where did you get that?

It's yours. From that day we found you---drifting at sea.

After all this time... I thought I'd lost it. It was a gift from my father...he sent it to me.

I'm sorry.

Why did you take it?

Because I was afraid that you were a pirate. That would have been awful.

Of course... Don't you see? It wasn't your blood they needed... it was my father's blood--- My blood. The blood...of a pirate.

How the blazes did you get off that island, Jack?

When you sailed away in my ship and marooned me on that godforsaken spit of land, with naught but a pistol and a single shot, you forgot one very important thing, mate. I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

I won't be makin' that mistake again.

Then what say you to puttin' the past behind us, untying these ropes, and letting me negotiate the return of your medallion, eh? What say you to that?

Seein' as how the Black Pearl's mine now, Jack, lettin' you go doesn't seem to fall within my interest.

Odd, I'm not actually concerned with YOUR INTEREST. Give me back the Pearl!

All right! Lock him in the brig!

We're comin' up on the Interceptor.

What do we do, Captain?

Whaddya think, you idiot?

Will, look!

What now?

I wonder what Jack would do?

I'm not sure. I suppose...he'd run for it.

Sounds good to me.

Will!

Everyone hit the deck!

We're just gonna have to fight!

Hooray!

We beat the pirates!

Well, did you now, laddie?

Jack!

Now then, I'll be having back that medallion. Unless it's more important than their lives?

Barbossa!

She goes free!

Go ahead boy---shoot! We can't die.

You can't... But I can!

My name is Will Turner! My father was Bootstrap Bill Turner! His blood runs in my veins!

On my word, do as I say, or I'll pull this trigger and be lost to Davy Jones' Locker.

Name your terms...Mr. Turner.

Release Elizabeth...and Sora, and Donald, and Goofy, too!

Anythin' else?

Leave now!

Agreed. Leave we shall...but the Heartless stay!

No fair!

Good work, Barbossa! Who knew it'd be this easy?

Barbossa, you coward!

That's the last time I trust a pirate!

The powder kegs are ready, Captain!

Then I bid ye farewell!

What are we gonna do!?

We'll be blown to smithereens!

Why struggle, mate? A pirate knows when to surrender.

Are you serious, Jack?

Your average pirate, anyway.

First, we've got to see to the gunpowder. I'm not about to lose this ship!

I still don't plan to trust pirates again.

Wise policy, lad.

All clear!

That's the second time I've had to watch that man sail away with my ship. But I'll be havin' her back soon enough.

You stay with the ship, lass!

I'll do no such thing! Will could die in there.

Dear William is fine. Trust me.

I am not a fool, Jack.

Then trust me instead!

Sora, Donald, Goofy---bring Will back safely!

Now, let's be tryin' this again! The last of the Aztec treasure has been returned.

And now, the blood will be repaid to free us from this curse forever! This time for sure!

Ahoy! Treasure, mateys!

Not possible.

Not probable! We're alive and we're pirates!

Captain Jack Sparrow!

Sora!

Donald Duck!

Goofy, too.

So you want to play pirate? Best save the playacting for the nursery. After them!

No more playacting now!

Thank you, Sora!

Uh, where's Jack?

Jack! Get him!

Huh?

Jack!

You're a fool, Jack Sparrow.

Jack...

Show yourself, Pete! The tide has changed.

See? I told ya you'd be needin' ol' Pete!

This ain't over!

Right! Care to surrender, Barbossa?

Well, enough of this, then...

What say you we call it---a draw?

Jack, how many times do I have to tell ya---

Laugh while you can, Barbossa!

I feel...cold.

What now, Jack?

Whatever I want, now that the Pearl is mine again.

That she is. Thank you, Jack.

I didn't want ye hittin' me again, mate.

Hey, Jack---good luck.

And remember to be good!

I'm off.

Will!

Good for them.

Uh-huh! Hey, Sora---how come your face is all red?

What? It is not red!

Aw, I know who you're thinking about.

You know...for a minute there...I was afraid we were gonna lose Donald to the curse of the treasure!

Yup. Me, too.

What!?

Agrabah! We made it!

Gawrsh, I wonder how Aladdin 'n' Jasmine are doin'?

Hey, maybe Riku's with them!

Yeah, and the King!

Keep dreaming, you two.

C'mon, Donald, you were thinking the same thing.

No, I wasn't!

Uh-oh, it's uh...um... It's Iago!

Wait! You got me all wrong.

You're Iago all right!

No! I mean, it's not the old me. I turned over a new feather. I'm legit! No more scams. Promise!

Bet that's your new scam.

Ya gotta believe me!

Sora, let's go!

I was stuck inside that lamp with Jafar. Remember? Well, I finally escaped. But then some things happened and...

So. Free as a bird, huh?

Have fun!

Gawrsh, fellas. He looks pretty sad.

I wanna apologize to Aladdin and Jasmine.

Could you guys maybe put in a good word for me?

Sure, we can do that, can't we?

Watch out!

Where are they all coming from?

This way!

Aw, we'd've been goners if Iago hadn't helped us. Ain't that right, fellas?

I guess we owe you one.

Perfect!

But you'll have to win over Aladdin and Jasmine yourself. Be on your best behavior, got it?

Yeah, I got it.

Where IS Aladdin, anyway?

I betcha he's at the palace.

Then let's go!

Jasmine!

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Your Majesty.

I never had the chance to thank you for before. You helped Aladdin defeat that awful Jafar and saved Agrabah.

All in a day's work. But uh... it looks like the Heartless are up to no good again.

Is there any way we can help you out?

I think we're all right for now.

And ya always got Aladdin.

He...hasn't been himself lately.

Is it because of the Heartless?

I'm not sure. Usually, he's the same cheerful Aladdin. But sometimes...he just seems sad. He leaves the palace and goes off by himself all the time. I've asked him about it, but he says nothing's wrong. He's gone again today. What if he doesn't come back this time?

Hey, maybe he's got a secret girlfriend. I know! I'll go find out who she is!

Iago! Quick, Sora, catch him!

And I'll warn the guards and everyone in the palace!

That's the thing, Iago's not...

Nice move.

Maybe it's something you said. Gee, maybe we should go talk to Aladdin. He's gotta be somewhere in town, right?

Good idea. I wonder what he's been doing.

Stop, thief!

Hi, Sora!

Come back here!

If you can't control that fur ball...put a leash on him!

Look, I'm sorry... You should be ashamed of yourself, Abu!

No hard feelings?

Abu!

Hey guys, sorry about earlier. I was kinda in a hurry.

What happened?

You know Abu. He couldn't keep his paws off that lamp.

No talking your way out of this one!

I guess you can't be THAT down in the dumps, huh?

Who said I was?

Princess Jasmine. She's worried 'cause you're always in town.

Got a new girlfriend?

No way! Still... I guess there's no foolin' Jasmine, huh? See, Genie and Carpet took off to see the world. It's what Genie always wanted, so I wished him the best and all, but...

You miss him.

Man, things must be REALLY quiet with Genie gone.

Yeah. That's why I come here. The action---the people. There's always something goin' on. I mean, c'mon! I met you guys here today, right? This place is full of surprises.

Uh, Sora?

Iago!? Oh, right... He wants to apologize for all the trouble he caused.

Oh, he does?

Gawrsh, he's so sorry, he's shakin'!

Th-th-that lamp!

What about it?

It was THE lamp!

C'mon. There're a million like it.

Hey! I was locked up in that thing FOR MONTHS! There's no way I'd mistake it!

Then we'd better go back and talk to that peddler.

Right behind you.

Is there any way we can buy that lamp from you?

Of course. That is...IF you can afford it.

No worries!

Yeah, we can pay you in royal treasu---

Donald!

Might I be able to interest you in another fine lamp?

No, that's the one we need.

Ah, well---perhaps I can be persuaded...IF you bring me a treasure beyond even my imagination. Something, say, fit for a sultan...

Treasure? That could be tricky...

There's lots at the palace.

But it's not mine to take. And I can't ask. I don't want to worry Jasmine or the Sultan.

Hey, I know... What about the treasure in the Cave of Wonders?

All right, Iago. You lead the way! And after we get the treasure, I might even believe your apology.

You can count on me!

This is it!







There. That one should do it.

Oh boy. It's perfect. That guy's gonna like this.

Sure looks valuable.

Great! Now let's go get that lamp.

We gotta keep Jafar bottled up, or he's gonna destroy Agrabah!

Stop!

Hey, snap out of it, Donald!

Why does this always happen?

Let's go!

Hello!

Stop your whining and hand it over!

Ohh no! I'm trading it for treasure. This lamp is going to bring me riches!

Oh no, you don't! Get back here, you!

Thank you.

It's mine!

Lamp hog!

Go away!

Gotcha!

No fair!

Heh heh, I win!

Nice one, Iago!

Way to go!

Don't drop it!

Look! Behind you!

Nice try, bird brain. Just wait till Jafar's free! He's gonna make one beauty of a Heartless!

I'm HOME!

Al! It's been eons!

Al, you princely little muffin, you!

Cosmic travel can get so lonely without a friend.

To think I left you forlorn and Genie-less... Oh, the HUMANITY!

Genie?

Hey, Al, you've been puttin' on weight?

Aw, of course, what am I saying? You're living at the palace now.

Aladdin!

Jasmine!

I can just picture it...

Wait, tell me. Am I being a pest? Just a big blue pest? Aw, who cares, Al! I'm just so glad to SEE you!

Genie!

Oops!

I'll teach you to make a fool out of me!

Time for Plan B! I'm finishin' you mugs off right now!

You! You've messed with me for the last time! I'm gonna get you yet!

Yeah! All right!

I promise---you won't regret givin' me another chance. Honest!

Uhhhh... Princess Jasmine, you sure that you want that pigeon in the coop?

Oh, I think Iago's shown that he means well.

Aw, sure. You're probably right.

And how much trouble can one noisy bird cause?

You might just have a point there, kid.

What happens next, Sora?

Well, it was great seeing you all...but we still need to find Riku and the King. I guess we'll be moving on.

I hope you find 'em.

Me, too.

Hey, where's Aladdin?

He ran off toward town, looking for Abu. But he should be back by now.

Al can't miss Sora's big farewell party! I'll have him back in a jiffy!

Abu!

Catch him!

He must've secretly stolen it from the Cave of Wonders.

Abu!

Wow!

I guess some things are just hard to resist.

Aw, who needs it!

Oh... I guess it got stuck!

What!?

Whoa!

Sora... What is it?

I think it's time for us to go.

Will you be back?

We will, I promise!

Maybe...waiting isn't good enough.

My thoughts exactly! If you have a dream, don't wait. Act. One of life's little rules. Got it memorized?

Who are you?

Axel. I happen to be an acquaintance of Sora's. Why don't we go see him?

...Sora?

We've got something in common, Kairi. You and I both miss someone we care about. Hey, I feel like we're friends already.

You're not acting very friendly!

Hey, what is this place?

You okay?

What...?

You and that dog came flying out of a hole in the wall. You nearly gave us heart attacks!

Hey, this is Halloween Town, right?

Well, it sure does look like Hallowee...Wha?

Hey, it's Zero! How've you been, boy?

What's that for?

It's Jack!

Sora, Donald, and Goofy! Welcome back, and Merry Christmas!

Merry Christmas? Don't you mean,
?

Of course. Halloween greetings from Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King.

Forgive me. I'm in a Christmas mood. You see, I'm running the show again this year---but I need Sandy Claws's blessing, so I'm off to Christmas Town.


?

I think he means Santa Claus.

Aren't these decorations wonderful? This year Halloween Town's going to handle Christmas too! But first! We have to visit Sally. She's working on something no self-respecting Santa Claus can do without. Come along---I'll show you!

A Halloween Town Christmas...

Wanna go check it out?

C'mon, hurry!

Hello, Doctor! Where's Sally?

Can't you see...that I'm in the middle of an experiment?

Hey, this is way too heavy!

Then let's toss it!

You do and you'll be sorry! Now bring it over here.

Heave-ho!

Imbeciles! Now my experiment is ruined!

Sally! Did you finish it? I want to show my good friends.

I'm sorry, Jack. I...I need a little bit more time.

Ohh... Well, that's all right. Just as long as it's ready for Christmas!

But... Jack...

I'd best be off. I've got to go get Sandy Claws, right away! Wonderful to see you again. Good-bye for now!

Go get Santa Claus...?

Please, Sora. I'm afraid something terrible will happen if Jack goes through with this.

You can say that again!

Sora?

Are those strange-looking fellows in the town square with you?

Huh? What
?

You know, the ones who wanted to spoil Halloween AND Christmas? What are they called again... Heartless?

They're definitely not with us. But Donald, Goofy, and I can get rid of them for you. And then we can go see Santa!

But first, the Heartless!

Now hear this, you...you things! Leave Halloween Town at once...by order of the mayor! Jack? Where are you? I'm only an elected official---I can't handle this by myself.

Jack!

We're on it!

How is Sandy Claws supposed to relax with all this going on? That's it, fellows! Sandy Claws needs bodyguards. Are you up to the task?

Us?

Yeah.

What should we bring along next time?

A bucketful of caterpillars!

Or something even worse!

Who's that?

Some old hag!

Silence!

A witch?

Hmm...perhaps you three could be of use to me. Come along, all of you. I'll show you the true meaning of


All right, bodyguards! Christmas Town is this way! The doorway is in the woods just past the graveyard!

Here it is! The door to Christmas Town. The spooks of Halloween can get so tiresome year after year. I wanted something new. And I found this! Beyond this door is a world filled with wonders...the likes of which you've never seen! As first I couldn't believe my eyes! Everything was so fresh and exciting!

C'mon! Just open it!

Cooool!

Wow!

So where's Santa?

In his workshop. Shall we?

Here too!?

En garde, loyal bodyguards!

Christmas is in big trouble!

Gawrsh, we can't let anything bad happen to Christmas.

That's where Sandy Claws lives.

Whoa!

Well, hello everyone. Did you come to see if you're on my
list?

Your name?

Um, Sora, sir.

Let's see...Sora...Here you are. Well, according to my list, Sora...seven years ago you told everyone you did not believe in Santa Claus... Oh, that is unfortunate.

How about Donald and Goofy?

Oh, boy!

Am I on your list, too, by any chance? It's me, Jack!

Jack Skellington!?

What sort of trouble did you bring this time?

This time?

It's a long story!

Why do we have to hide?

Silence! Well, this is a pleasant surprise. That fool Jack brought Sora and the others with him. Now we can deal with all of them at once!

What do you want us to do?

Who's there?

Busted!

It's Lock, Shock, and Barrel!

Not those three...

I assure you, they're not with us.

Well, whatever the case, they've been quite naughty. Catch them and bring them back here. They're going to get a lecture.

Uh...Mr. Claws? I wanted to talk to you about Christmas first.

It'll have to wait. I need to see how things are progressing in my workshop.

C'mon, Jack---let's catch those little pranksters.

Oh, all right, then.

I was so looking forward to destroying that ridiculous Christmas Town. But now that Sora and those imbeciles are here I think a change of plan is called for. Revenge before pleasure, after all.

What kind of revenge?

The magnificent, malevolent kind, of course.

That sounds really bad.

Like Oogie's kinda bad!

And that's super-duper bad!

Oogie Boogie? That bag of incensed insects? How intriguing. And where might I find him?

Jack and his dumb, stupid friend destroyed him.

Ah yes, now I remember. More intriguing still! I believe I'll bring your master back for you.

I feel like a million bugs! I really owe you one for this, Maleficent.

Indeed you do, Oogie. Do you remember Sora, Donald, and Goofy?

Do I remember them? Ha! You're too much! I'll never forget what they did to me... Uh...What was it they did to me?

Squashed you like a bug!

That sounds bad!

And Jack helped!

Even worse!

They creamed ya!

That's right, that's right! That's one thing I won't be forgetting any time soon! It's the last thing I remember. And it's the only thing I remember until I teach those clowns not to mess with Mr. Oogie Boogie!

Yes...that's right. That's the spirit. And I have the perfect plan already in mind.

Have you ever heard of Christmas Town?

Mr. Oogie!

Wake up! Wake up!

We want to see how bad you are!

It seems he needs more time to recover. You three---stay here and keep Sora and the others occupied.

My Heartless will help you. But do not fail me!

There they are!

Stop them!

Tie 'em down!

Get 'em!

Ah ha ha ha!

That was fun!

Let's go see if Mr. Oogie's ready!

Oogie!?

Isn't he the one who tried to take over Halloween Town before?

That's him. Fellows, I hope you're ready for trouble...

Don't we have enough trouble already?

Confound it. Now I've lost my way.

Oh, this is utter foolishness. I should be getting ready for Christmas.

Is that you... Mr. Sandy Claws?

Yes, but...please, call me Santa Claus.

Of course. Mr. Santa Claus, I was hoping I'd find you here. You see... It's very important that you go back to Christmas Town. I'm afraid something terrible is going to happen if you don't.

Well, I am behind on my preparations... All right. Tell Jack I'll be waiting for him at home. He had something to say to me about Christmas.

But that's just it. Please, go home and lock the door. And if Jack knocks, don't open it!

There. The large one in red.

All I gotta do is kidnap him?

That's right. Lock him up at once! Then begin destroying Christmas Town. That's sure to make Sora and the other fools come running.

And then they're all mine!

Yes. And in the meantime, I'll turn Santa Claus into Santa Heartless!

Are we done?

Who's there?

What's wrong, Sally?

Jack! Oogie's kidnapped Santa Claus!

Oh, no!

And he's headed to Christmas Town!

C'mon, Jack---let's hurry!

I've done a little redecorating!

Wait... Something's not quite right. I know what it is! We just need a little more of that Oogie flair!

I do hope our jolly old friend is looking forward to becoming a Heartless.

Clumsy oaf!

Are you still here? Why don't you Oogie on back where you came from. You're crampin' my style!

Have you already forgotten who brought you back, you insolent bag of bugs?

Sorry! Can't remember a thing!

Very well, you ingrate. You'll rue the day you spurned my help!

That's Santa's house!

Jack Skellington!

Oogie!

You and I have a score to settle, Jack! Same goes for your little sidekicks!

What are you planning to do with Sandy Claws?

Who? Sandy Claws? I don't know what you're talking about!

And why is this roly-poly red guy here? Time to go, grandpa!

Eh?

Mr. Santa Claus!

Why, you...

Stop!

Huh?

Not again!

Nice view from up here!

That's right, away you go!

All right, Christmas is safe again!

Perfect! I'd better get down to business!

Leave that to Santa!

Yup, you oughta stick to Halloween and spooky stuff!

Jack?

Here, it's done.

Wonderful! Why, I love it! Thank you, Sally!

Jack... Do you really have to do this?

But I make a splendid Sandy Claws!

Listen here, Jack Skellington. You saved me, and Christmas as well. And for that, I'm very grateful. But please promise you won't cause any more trouble! And about that suit!

Don't even think about taking over for me again!

I just thought you could use a little help this year, Mr. Claws. You must be exhausted from all the preparations. And---I wouldn't mind a second chance to get this Christmas thing right.

Yes, being Santa Claus can be tiring. But let me tell you something, Jack. Seeing the happy faces of little children when they discover the presents I've brought them makes it all worthwhile, year after year after year. And you, Jack---you love to make them gasp and see them shiver with fright. What if someone tried to take all of that away from you?

We both have very important jobs to do, Jack. Mine is to take care of Christmas, and yours is to take care of Halloween. So we each have to do the very best we can. After all, you're the face of Halloween---Mr. Jack Skellington! The Pumpkin King! The Knight of Nightmares! And even though you're fascinated with Christmas, Jack...Halloween is your true specialty. Don't you see? Children rely on both of us to do our jobs. Halloween needs your attention...and I know Christmas needs mine---urgently.

You're right! I am the master of terror! And if Halloween has become too routine, all I have to do is think of something new that'll really make them scream!

Jack! Oh, Jack! I've been looking for you everywhere! We must go over the plans for next Halloween! I can't do a thing without your approval!

So true.

Good luck, Jack Skellington.

Well, there he goes.

Yes, and I've got lots of names to check and preparations to finish!

Jack, this is no time for joking!

What's this? Perhaps a bit too festive for our Halloween needs.

We better get going.

Before you do, Sora... I believe there's a friend of yours...who---if I recall correctly---was the one who told you there's no such thing as Santa Claus?

Oh yeah... He did say that.

Be sure to give him my very best wishes.

I will, but... Do you know where I can find Riku?

No...but don't give up! Remember, if you believe in Riku, you will find him. Just as you found me.

Right!

Nooooo!

Nooooo!

Hey! Check us out.

This place is kinda creepy, though.

Uh-huh.

Heartless?

I dunno, Sora. I get the feelin' they might live here.

Don't mind us! Just passing through. We won't be any trouble.

Yeah, that's right!

Don't be silly. We'd love you to stick around for lunch.

Um...we didn't bring anything to eat.

That's not gonna be a problem!

Gawrsh, Sora---I think WE'RE the lunch!

Going somewhere?

Man, that Scar's got the worst timing.

Just let him roar.

Nah, we better go see what he wants. Sounds like he's grumpy enough already.

Fine.

I dunno what that was about, but I'm glad it's over!

Everything's harder on four legs...

Better start practicing!

I found a trick to it. Here, lemme show ya.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

Heartless!?

What do we do?

Stay back!

Definitely Heartless.

Thank you. You really saved me.

We're just glad you're okay.

Did you see any other Heartless around here?

Heartless... Is that what they're called? I'm not sure if there are any others... I don't usually hunt outside the Pride Lands.

Pride Lands?

Hey, do you know if a guy named Riku is there? Or some bad guys in black hoods? Or maybe this really big bully named Pete?

Oh well, we might as well go take a look, anyway.

Wait---the Pride Lands are dangerous. Scar and the hyenas have made things unbearable for everyone. There's no food left. They've driven off the prey. We're about to starve.

We can handle a little danger. You just saw us beat those Heartless, didn't you?

I guess you're right... You could be just what the kingdom needs. Maybe you can help us.

Ya mean take on this Scar guy and all those hyenas?

Scar?

He took over when our last king, Mufasa, died.

So you're saying this guy is your king. You want us to take down your king?

Wait just a minute. We can't just go around knocking kings off their thrones. Then again, if they see that I'm stronger than their king, maybe they'll ask me to be their next king!

Sora...

I'd have to refuse, of course. Still, I'd like to see the Pride Lands, so you guys don't mind lending 'em a paw, do you?

Uh-oh, there he goes again...

She's gonna go on ahead and tell the other lionesses. We're supposed to meet her at a place called Pride Rock.

That's him.

Uh....what?

What is it?

I told Rafiki you might be able to help us force Scar and the hyenas out of the Pride Lands. But he says it won't work. You see, whoever saves the Pride Lands will be our next king...and he has to have the right qualities.

Meaning...

I think she means you're not cut out for the job, Sora.

I'm sorry you came all this way.

Hey, no---it's okay.

You'd better go before Scar finds out you're here. I'm really sorry.

Hey---a snack.

Snack? Nah, we got us a three course meal.

Look at that, here comes Scar---the king.

And Pete!

My back...

What are you doing here!?

Aww, the cute li'l kitty's worried about me. If I were you, I'd be more worried about my friends!

Sora!

We're surrounded!

Go on, ladies---you've got some hunting to do.

The herds have moved on, Scar. We can't hunt in a land with no prey.

No prey? Then what do you call this?

We're not prey!

Oh. Nice and fresh, too.

Well, they're all yours, Scar.

Run!

Follow me!

I'm sorry I got you involved in this.

It's no big deal.

Aw, it's not your fault. Sora wouldn't be a good king.

Hey! I had to give it a try, right?

So you DID want to be king!

Well...you know... Uh, Nala, isn't there anybody else who could be king?

There was... but he died... when he was just a cub. He was the son of our last king, Mufasa. If only Simba were here...

Simba!? But Simba's just fine! He was fighting right beside us not that long ago.

You mean Simba's alive!? But where is he?

That... I don't know.

Still... Simba's alive! I can't believe it... Please---tell me more about him.

Of course!

But first, we should get away from Scar. We'll go through Wildebeest Valley. He won't follow us there.

Hey, why the long face, Simba? You gotta lighten up and live a little!

Y-yeah...

What were you thinkin' about?

Lemme guess. The past, right?

Hakuna matata!

Would you look how he's grown, Pumbaa. Why, when I rescued the little guy, he was only this big.

Wow!

What's wrong?

We're never gonna make it.

I guess Rafiki was right.

What?

Never mind. It's not important. Here, I'll show you how. You can do it!

When Simba's father, King Mufasa, died, we were told that Simba died alongside him.

Who told you that?

Scar.

It is time.

It must be Simba! Sora! Hurry!

Wait up!

Simba!

I-it's me---Sora! Donald and Goofy are here, too.

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

What happened to you?

Help! Simba! Heeelp!

She's gonna eat us!

Timon? Pumbaa!? Something must have happened in the jungle! I have to go help my friends!

Okay, we'll back you up!

Simba! Wait!

Stop!

It's Nala! Don't you recognize her?

Nala?

It's me, Simba!

Simba!

You are alive!

Hey! What's goin' on here!?

Don't worry. They're all friends of mine.

So that means...nobody's planning to eat anybody else for lunch, right?

Are you sure they don't wanna eat me like I'm some kinda pig!?

We won't...but you are a pig, right?

Call me Mr. Pig!

Could you guys excuse us for a few minutes?

Why am I not surprised?

Simba, you've got to come back to Pride Rock. I thought Sora might be able to help, but you're the only one who can save us from Scar.

I can't go back.

Why?

Hakuna matata. It's something I learned out here. Sometimes bad things happen and there's nothing you can do about it.

Simba...

Hakuna!

Matata!

Hakuna!

Matata!

He's not the Simba I remember. Something about hakuna matata...

My father's dead. And it's because of me... It's my fault. I can't go back... It won't change anything.

Look at the stars. The great kings of the past look down on us from those stars. So whenever you feel alone, just remember that those kinds will always be there to guide you... And so will I.

Father...are you there?

Simba... you have forgotten who you are. You must take your place in the Circle of Life.

How can I go back? I'm not who I used to be.

Remember who you are.

You can all come out now.

I'm going back to face my past. I could use your help.

He really is a king...

Wait a minute. We're gonna fight your uncle for THIS?

Yes, Timon. This is my home.

Simba! You're...alive!

This kingdom doesn't belong to you.

Simba's the rightful king.

The choice is yours, Scar. Either step down or fight.

Must this all end in violence? I'd hate to be responsible for the death of a family member, Simba...

I've put the past behind me.

But what about your faithful subjects? Have they?

Simba, what's he talking about?

Go on. Tell them who's responsible for Mufasa's death!

I am.

He admits it! Murderer! If it weren't for you, Mufasa would still be alive. Do you deny it?

No! But it was an accident!

You're in trouble again. But this time, Daddy isn't here to save you. And now everyone knows why!

Now this looks familiar. I think I've seen this before. Oh, yes! I remember. This is just the way your father looked...before he died.

And here's my little secret... I killed Mufasa.

Murderer! Tell them the truth!

All right. All right! I did it.

Louder!

I...killed...Mufasa!

Simba! You get Scar! We'll handle these guys!

'Scuse me! Pardon me! Comin' through!

Where's Simba?

He went up there.

Simba!

This is his fight, Donald.

You're okay!

Aw, that was just a sneak preview! 'Cause this ain't over---not by a long shot!

Anger and jealousy turned the king of Pride Rock into a Heartless! Oh, your kingdom's gonna rise again...

But this time, as the Pride Lands of Darkness!

That's what you think!

I am the king!

Simba...

Hey, what's with the light show?

We have to say goodbye for a little while.

I'll go tell Simba.

Aw, he's prob'ly busy. Just tell him we'll be back soon.

Oh, that's right---he's king now. He's gonna be so busy he'll prob'ly forget all about his two best buddies.

Well, you always got hakuna matata, right?

Guess so...

Whaddaya mean,
!? What if he forgets to tell the carnivores who we are? One look at you, and you're a pig roast.

That's MISTER Pig Roast.

Same thing! And I'm not sticking around to be anybody's pork dinner!

Pumbaa!

You can never forget your true buddies.

Looky there! Twilight Town!

Yep, I can see it! It's back again!

H-Help! The sandlot! It's Seifer! Somebody please help us!

Sound like we've got trouble!

We'll take it from here!

Impressive.

By the way, have you seen a man named Axel? I expect he's here somewhere.

Like I care.

You see, Axel's no longer acting in our best interest.

Is he with the Organization, too?

Yes.

You havin' a fight?

Not a very organized Organization...

Don't let your guard down. Axel will stop at nothing to turn you into a Heartless.

Gee, thanks for looking out for us, mister. But I'm sure we can take care of ourselves just fine.

Glad to hear it. Axel aside, it would break our hearts to hear something happened to you.

Hearts? You don't have any hearts!

True, we don't have hearts.

But we remember what it was like. That's what makes us special.

Whaddya mean?

We know very well how to injure a heart. Sora, you just keep on fighting those Heartless.

Let's jump in after him!

How come?

I'm not sure, but maybe he'll lead us to the Organization's world.

Don't be reckless. Do you want to end up like Riku?

What!?

Hey, wait! ...What did he mean, end up like Riku?

Hey, how 'bout you get out of my town now? You've caused enough trouble.

Riku...

Have it your way! C'mon, guys.

Hold it!

Make up your mind!

This goes to the strongest guy in Twilight Town.

Thanks, but...we don't really need it.

Whoa!

Oh! Sora!

Um...Pence, right?

Do you know a girl named Kairi?

K...Kairi!? I sure do!

Then you better come to the station!

He-ey!

Hey, so how do you guys know Kairi?

Kairi was really here!?

Yeah. And...she said she was looking for you.

Tell me where she is!

Well...

What a romantic story!

If you stick around, Sora's bound to show up.

Yeah, he said he's coming back.

Okay!

What took you so long, Kairi?

Somehow I just knew you'd be here. I tell ya, Kairi, you've got a lot of guts, jumping right into the darkness like that.

Let go of me! Let go!

Kairi...

Ya think it mighta been Axel?

Sorry...

Hey, it's not your fault. C'mon, cheer up! Like I can even say that...

I gotta help Kairi!

Whoa!

That was close!

Sora!?

Sora! Are you okay?

Huh? What...?

Wh-what just happened?

A new road is open. And Kairi and Riku are waiting somewhere along it.

You'd better hurry, then.

You comin' back?

Promise!

I passed on the message as you so desired. I told the young Sora to keep defeating the Heartless.

Good. Not only have you the power to inflict pain, you also have the power to plant seeds of doubt in one's receptive heart.

Sora will soon begin to doubt himself. It will cause him to hesitate and that hesitation will turn to anger. That anger will fuel him to get rid of his apprehension and move forward. He will pave the way for the future we desire.

There's something I've meant to ask.

About Axel?

The poor fool. How long will he keep chasing the illusion of friendship, when he himself lacks emotion? Trying so hard to retrieve what he has lost, when it may never have existed in the first place. He deserves nothing more than our pity.

The King, Riku---and now I've lost Kairi again, too.

Don't be sad!

Donald's right, you know! Why, you're the key that connects everything!

So it's all MY fault.

Gawrsh, I didn't mean that. Just do what comes natural to ya and we're sure to find 'em.

You said it!

Thanks, guys.

Oh no! Hollow Bastion! It's all covered in darkness!

You're right, Chipper! I wonder what's goin' on.

Sora! We better hurry and check it out right away!

Do you think...

Looks like there's more Heartless now.

Uhhh....

Let's go check in with everyone.

I think they're at Merlin's.

Ach! I was so close to recreating that flavor, too...

What, lads? Leon and his friends are in the borough. Aye, Merlin's house.

Oh, Cloud!

Whatcha doing?

I'll get him. This time we settle it. Me, and the one who embodies all the darkness in me.

I thought you looked kinda different, Cloud.

If I do, it's his fault.

Whose?

Sephiroth. Tell me if you see him.

Okay. What's he look like?

Silver hair. Carries a long sword.

Sure. Well, be seeing you, Cloud.

Be careful. He messes with your head, makes you think darkness is the only way.

Is something wrong?

Uhh...

It's nothing.

I don't want you involved.

You mean you don't want me there when you go away again?

I just--- Listen, even if I go far away, I'll come back.

Do you mean it?

Yeah.

See? You don't look so sure. Well, okay, I understand. Go---get things settled.

Huh?

No matter how far away you are...once you find your light...I'm sure it will lead you back here again. Right?

I suppose.

So I'll stay here---and I'll cheer for you--- Okay, Cloud?

Okay.

Wonder if he'll be okay.

He'll be fine. I'm sure there's some light in him somewhere.

You're right.

Hey, fellas---you're just in time. Got some good news for ya, so get yourselves over to Leon's.

What kind of news?

We found the computer Ansem was using!

Oh boy!

Yep. Should be able to get all kinds of info on the Heartless and the Organization.

And maybe something on the dark realm, too? It looks like that's where Riku and Kairi are.

And the King.

Go see for yourselves!

It can't hurt!

What do you mean?

Nothin'. Just get to the computer room through the castle postern. Watch your step!

Excuse me, are you with the Restoration Committee?

What's Leon's gang up to?

They've got stuff to do over by the castle postern.

Scoop!

Huh?

Let's report.

To who?

Our leader, of course!

Yeah, you know, Malefi---

Don't mind her. I assure you, we come in peace.

You're kidding...

Problem?

Okay, fine. You do the talking.

So sorry about this!

Leon!

Over here!

You guys found Ansem's computer?

Uh-huh. The King is very interested in it.

The King?

He's with Leon.

We get to see the King!

Hooray!

Er... Is Riku with them?

Well, at least I can ask the King about him. And that computer might be able to tell us something.

Good idea! They're right through there.

Ansem...

Gawrsh, I guess this must be his room.

Where's the King?

Hello?

Hey, you!

I'm looking for somebody. Have any of you seen a guy with spiky hair?

Spikier.

I'll just take a look around.

Sorry to bother you.

No bother, ma'am!

So you made it.

Leon!

Isn't the King with you?

You'll see him soon enough.

Hey!

Here, this ought to tide you over.

Ansem's computer room.

This is it! Where's Kairi? Where's Riku?

Easy... You wanna break it?

Oh, sorry. Guess I got a little carried away.

Whoa!

Hmm?

Whoa!

Get offa there!

Attention current user. This is a warning. Further misuse of this terminal will result in immediate defensive action.

Who's there?

I am the Master Control Program. I oversee this system.

Where are you?

Donald!

I'm sorry...

Decision gate reached. You are now under arrest.

Arrest!?

Run!

Sora!

Go one, show 'em who's boss!

Who're you?

I am Commander Sark.

A Heartless commander?

Observe.

Okay, you're the boss! I get it.

Man, what kind of world is this, anyway?

You're inside a mainframe computer system.

A what system?

A computer system---for processing data. This system is a copy of one created by a corporation called ENCOM. The original program was destroyed.

But this copy was acquired by another User. The new User updated and customized the programs, renaming the system
He used the system for town maintenance, and to advance his private research. My name is Tron. I'm a security program. But now I'm under arrest, same as you.

Did you guys get any of that?

Gawrsh... You know...maybe we should just introduce ourselves.

I'm Sora.

And I'm Donald.

Nice to meet'cha, Tron. I'm Goofy.

With that configuration, you must be Users.

Users?

You'd better get out of here quickly. Who knows what the MCP will do to you?

MCP?

The Master Control Program. It controls the whole system. If you idle here, you will be de-rezzed.

De-rezzed!?

So, how do we get outta here!?

This terminal could've gotten you back to the User world. But the MCP cut the power 50 microcycles ago.

If we could bring the energy core in the canyon online, we could power it back up. The problem is---we're stuck in this cell. We're not going anywhere unless we unlock the energy fields.

Master Control. Why not just de-rezz Tron?

I still haven't located the password to the dataspace.

What about a logic probe? With all your processing power...

Out of the question. The current environment hampers the processing power needed for such an analysis.

You're dismissed, Sark. Stop any remaining anomalies in the system---or else. End of line.

Acknowledged.

Remarkable... It seems you have some unique functions. I'll go with you to the canyon. You'll need someone who can interface with the energy core, right?

If you say so... Thanks, Tron.

This is the energy core.

Mission accomplished?

Yes. Now...will you do something for me?

You got it!

Don't you want to hear what it is first?

You helped us! Now it's our turn.

You guys really are Users. Your actions are totally illogical.

Let's hurry back to the pit cell.

Where's that again?

That's the sector where we met.

Roger!

So what did you want us to do?

Find my User. He'll give you the password to access the DTD.

You bet!

So, um...

DTD is the name my User gave to the dataspace. Copies of all the original system programs are stored there, along with anything that's sensitive or restricted.

Is there stuff about the Heartless, or Organization XIII?

Hmm...Most likely.

A number of my functions were appropriated when I last took on the MCP. That's why I need the password. If I can get inside the DTD, I can access my original backup program and restore all my functions. Then, I'll be able to put this system back the way it was before the MCP got control and changed everything. The way it was supposed to be---a free system for you---the Users.

Gee, Tron, ain't the MCP one of those programs, too? Do ya know who it was who made it?

Actually...I don't know.

Okay, we'll just have to find your user and ask him. What's his name?

You mean you don't know? My user is the user of this system Ansem the Wise.

Ansem!?

Looks like the MCP's on to us. I'll keep this terminal up and running. You better exit the system, now!

Sure... But Tron...Ansem is...

We'll get ya the password!

Okay. You're good to go. Hurry!

We did it!

Where have you been?

Well, uh... There's a...world inside this computer, where these, um...programs live, and...

So in other words...Ansem's research data is off-limits unless we know the password.

I think that's right.

But you've already defeated Ansem...

Gawrsh, maybe we'll never find the password.

That means...this is all a wild goose chase.

You're chasing what, now? Well, well! A hidden room! Guess I'd better take another look around.

She just won't give up...

And neither will we!

C'mon, we've gotta look for that password!

Right. We made a promise to Tron.

Excuse me.

What's this doodle?

Hollow...Main...Security...Tron... Door to...

Looks like a diagram or somethin'.

Door...to...darkness?

Oh!

D---T---D!

DTD!

What's up?

Look at this! This must be the dataspace! The DTD. See? The Door To Darkness!

What do you know. But...that still leaves the password.

Say, fellas, did somebody mention the Door To Darkness?

Your Majesty!

Long time no see!

Shh!

The Organization might be listening!

You mentioned the Door To Darkness?

Uh, yes, sir! Ya see, we're lookin' for the secret password.

Password?

Oh, I guess you mean like a code.

Well, the Door To Darkness can only be opened by the seven princesses. There's Snow White, Jasmine, and Belle...

Of course...

What're you trying to do?

With that password, we can get access to Ansem's research data.

So that means you might be able to find out where he is!

Stop jokin' around, Your Majesty. We already defeated Ansem. You know that.

Looks like I've got a lot of explainin' to do.

We're listening, Your Majesty!

Okay...but first, I've got a question...

Hey, isn't Tron waiting for you guys?

Don't worry, I'm not goin' anywhere. If those Heartless attack, I'll stand and fight with everybody here.

Yeah...we will, too.

Then let's talk more later.

That's a promise!

I'll see ya when you get back. Oh! One more thing. Let me give your clothes some new powers, Sora.

Really!?

You bet! You've done so much---just consider it a thank-you present.

Thanks, Your Majesty! We're heading off to see Tron now, so wait here for us, okay?

I will, Sora. And remember---be careful!

Gawrsh, I wonder where Tron is.

Don't touch that!

Huh?

Goofy!

Uhh...I didn't do it!

I didn't touch nothin'!

Welcome to the game grid.

Game grid?

That's right, you've been chosen to play a few games. Lose, and you will be subject to immediate de-resolution. Win? Well,
no one wins.

We're not gonna play your games!

You have no choice.

Well then, get on with it!

All right! It looks like we can escape through there!

Tron!

I don't understand. Why are you here?

We came to give you the password.

Why didn't you just transmit the data?

Transmit?

Hey, are you okay?

I'll be all right...once we access the DTD.

All right, what's the password?

Well...Belle, Snow White...

Aurora, Alice, Jasmine, Cinderella...

Kairi.

Kairi, got it.

That did it!

Now switching DTD over from hibernation to active mode. This process will take some time. Please enjoy a game while the process is running.

Oh, no!

Not another game!

No, it's the DTD's final security routine. This isn't a game. Stay focused!

Warning! You will be de-rezzed!

I'm as good as new! All my functions have been restored!

Oh boy!

Finally. I have full access to the DTD. My takeover of the system is now complete. I might have anticipated such a simple password. What's this? An emergency destruct program for the town. Let's see how it performs.

No!

Program! You changed the password!

There, that should buy us some time.

Tron! Tell us what's going on!

The MCP's loading a hostile program into the I/O tower.

What do we do?

We've got to protect the User town.

Let's head to the tower!

It must be total chaos outside.

I think there's gonna be trouble INSIDE, too...

I'm disappointed in you, Program. Why do you insist on allying with these selfish Users?

Because I want to help them. Something written into my code commands me to do what is right.

Really? And what command would that be?

I can't really say for sure.

Friends--- They help each other, that's all.

Uh-oh---look out!

I really owe you one. With all my functions up and running, I think I've got a chance of getting system control away from the MCP. Now I'd better get to work. It's what my User would want.

What Ansem would want...

Listen, Tron. We didn't get the password from Ansem. We just sort of found it, back in the User world. By accident. And one more thing...Ansem---he was our enemy. I mean...he still is...I guess.

Well, actually...he's my enemy, too.

What do you mean?

Ansem took ENCOM's original system and customized it for his own use. I was part of the original system, and Ansem modified me, too. So that makes him my User.

But Ansem is also the one who brought back the MCP. The Ansem I first knew wouldn't do that. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

That's okay...but now I REALLY don't get it.

I don't...understand it either. But I think Users, like you, are going to be the ones who will finally figure it out. You have the ability to take illogical routes and still arrive at the answers you seek. Now go---before the MCP starts acting up again! Any data you need from the DTD can be accessed directly through my User's terminal. I'll keep a dedicated access channel open for you. I changed the password, so you won't have to worry about the MCP for a while.

Access channel?

I knew you'd ask.

It's a very important link between our worlds. It's how we stay connected.

You...my friends...are the new password.

Thanks Tron! Take care!

You too! And give my best to the Users!

Well, that's that!

Look.

Tron...hang in there.

So, where do we start?

I know! Let's access the DTD!

The King's checking the situation in town. He'll be back soon, so don't worry. Hey, look, it's asking for a password.

That's easy. It's...

Sora!

Donald!

Goofy!

That's...to the point.

Well?

That did it. We're in. I have to go into town. Need to see what that last shakeup did.

You're not gonna check out the data? It wasn't exactly easy to get!

I'm coming right back. Hey, Sora---why don't you get started on loading the data and copying it down?

It's just a few keystrokes. Easy, right?

Did it work?

Hey, these things take time, okay?

Whoa... It's doing something!

Huh?

I think it wants to know what we wanna know.

Riku and Kairi!

No way... Even Ansem's computer doesn't know...

Whatcha doing?

I thought I'd ask the computer if it can tell us about them Nobodies.

What's this?

The data is corrupt.

What!?

How about the Organization?

There!

The data is corrupt.

Stupid computer!

Sora!

Who's this guy?

Well, I see ya got things workin'!

Oh, Your Majesty!

Good goin'. The computer should tell us the things we need to know.

But it keeps on sayin' the data inside's all ker-skuffled.

All we got is a picture of some guy we don't know.

Ansem the Wise!

Come on, are you teasing us again?

Did you forget what Ansem looked like, Your Majesty?

Of course I do! And this is him! I'm positive!

Huh?

Excuse me? Could you come this way, please?

Look, THIS is Ansem. You know, the guy we all worked reeeally hard to defeat?

Oh, that's right---I never finished explaining.

What?

Well, the man in the picture is definitely the one who tried to take over Kingdom Hearts---the one you fellas defeated.

But, what you actually fought was his Heartless. Ya see, he wasn't really Ansem. He just went around telling everybody that he was.

You mean...

Ohh...

Hmm...

Whaaaat?

We went through all that trouble to defeat an impostor?

Yep. A fake. But he still had to be stopped.

Aw, I can't believe it...

Uh, I'm kinda confused. If he's a fake, then what happened to the real Ansem?

Well, that's just what I'm tryin' to figure out. Ansem the Wise should know all about Organization XIII's plans, and what's been happening to the worlds. I'm pretty sure he'll give us some help. Ya know, I came close to finding him once...

Hmm?

Don't tell me there's more...I'm lost enough as it is!

Well, let's see. Some feller named Ansem, who wasn't really Ansem, became a Heartless. Does that mean a Nobody got created when that happened, too?

Yup! And that Nobody is the leader of the Organization.

Whaaaat?

I know I've met this fake Ansem before, and I've seen the leader of Organization XIII, too. Hmm, kinda felt like bein' around the same fella.

So, where did you meet this guy?

Gosh...I can't remember. Ansem the Wise---the real Ansem---must know the imposter's true identity. That's why I've got to find him and ask him about it.

You...! You started all of this! Because of you, Riku and Kairi... Oh! Your Majesty, do you know where Riku is?

He's... I'm sorry. I can't help.

Really, Your Majesty? Are you sure?

I'm sorry, Sora.

What about Kairi? Organization XIII might've kidnapped her.

Oh, no!

Sora, Donald, Goofy. I was plannin' to go get help from Ansem the Wise. But---now I know I forgot the most important thing. Helping others should always come before asking others for help. We're safe and sound---and free to choose! So there's no reason we shouldn't choose to help our friends.

Let's look for Riku and Kairi together.

Outside!

Sounds like we gotta start by helpin' out here!

Here me, my Heartless! Attack the white husks! Sweep them away!

What, are you nuts? We're never gonna win! I don't know about you, but I'm outta here, sister!

You pathetic coward!

Heartless! Leave the white ones. Turn your attention to Sora and his friends!

Uh-oh!

Where's Maleficent?

Looks like she ran away.

Well, that was PRET-ty lame of her.

I guess we picked the wrong side.

Umm, hey...if you're looking to pick sides, why don't you pick Leon's? They can always use help.

Does this Leon have any treasure?

Yeah, lots of stuff!

Perfect!

Come on.

Who ARE you?

Oh, we're nothing worth mentioning.

Just three treasure fanatics.

Later, taters!

Did Leon...really have any treasure?

We don't have time for you!

Whoa!

Sora, it's Sephiroth!

Ain't Sephiroth the one who's supposed to be the dark part of Cloud's heart?

Did Cloud tell you that? Then he must understand now.

Just what are you gonna do to him?

Nothing. Cloud is the one who hungers for Darkness.

He said he's got a score to settle with you.

I see... He wants to meet me again.

Then I should give him what he wants. That last bit of light is always the hardest to snuff out.

Sora! Behind you!

The King's in the bailey. You better head over there!

Got it!

Whoa...

Think you can handle this many?

Well... Might be tough if one more shows up.

Then that'll have to be the one I take care of.

What, you're fighting too?

Sephiroth!

I understand that you've been looking for me.

Yeah. Once I get rid of you, the darkness will go away.

Can you do it? That darkness comes from your own dark memories. Do you think you can erase your past?

Shut up!

Face it---you turn your back on the present and live in the past. Because the light of the present is too much!

You don't know me!

Cloud!

I know. Because...I am you.

Cloud! Wait!

Leon, everybody---hang in there!

Okay, fellas, you've gotta go find Riku and Kairi!

But Leon and the others are friends too!

Don't worry. There's already lotsa help here. We'll take care of this fight.

But...I promised Leon!

Donald! Goofy!

Take Sora and get goin'!

Riku, Kairi...give me a little time, okay?

Your Majesty!

We understand. We'll go search for Riku and Kairi!

Right. Watch for danger!

You be careful, too!

Wait, you guys!

Sora, do as you're told!

You're comin' with us whether ya want to or not!

C'mon, Sora! Ya gotta be good!

Gotcha.

Well then, skedaddle!

Let's go!

I'm sorry, Your Majesty!

Hope you can forgive us!

Master Ansem. Regarding the experiment I presented the other day... With your permission, I'd like to proceed---

I forbid it! Forget this talk of doors, and the heart of all worlds. That place must not be defiled!

But, Master Ansem! I've been thinking...

Xehanort...Those thoughts are best forgotten.

It has been far too long...friend.


Zexion! Zexion!

Right here! What is it?

Where is Lord Xemnas?

His usual spot.

The
.

Yes. Go and see for yourself.

That isn't funny! I suppose I have no choice but to wait.

But the clock is ticking. Time is running out! What to do... Why is he never around when I need him? It's almost as if he knows I'm looking for him. The whole world is...

Y'know, I don't like that place either.

What about you, Zexion? What do you think?

I think eavesdropping is intrusive. Why are you even here? You and Xaldin were tasked to recruit new members.

Have you forgotten? Or were you procrastinating?

As if! I'm doing my job. I'll have you know I found one just yesterday.
something. That puts the Organization's count at 11. And since I've been working so hard, I had Lexaeus take my place for the day. I want to rest up for tomorrow, so I can wake up feeling nice and refreshed.

Is that so? Well then, I will leave you to it. I've work to catch up on. Good day.

Don't be like that. C'mon, stay and talk.

Isn't it time you told me about Xemnas's secret?

How long ago was it... When a bunch of warriors wielding key-shaped swords appeared and unleashed a spectacular battle. And when it was all over, all that was left was a man lying unconscious without his memories. Xemnas--Uh, I mean Xehanort, was found by Ansem right around then, wasn't he?

Your point?

The
. If you recall, that's where we spent our time researching the darkness that resides within people's hearts. It's a graveyard that was sealed by order of Ansem the Wise. The first thing Xemnas did once he got rid of him was to undo the seal and build a room in the back. Ever since then, he holds himself up in that room when he can, and he talks to someone.

But who? For all I know, he's the only one in that room.

Need I repeat myself about eavesdropping.

Not eavesdropping. Couldn't hear what they were saying. Dying to find out what it was though. You wouldn't know anything about it, would you?

I know I would very much like to focus on my own duties...

...as you should with yours. For we need to prepare the new facility immediately. But there are only eleven of us in the Organization. We're going to need a few more hands on deck.

What new facility? Oh, you mean Castle Oblivion. What does Xemnas plan on doing with that place anyway?

He already shared his intentions with us.

But did you know there's something he didn't share?

The
is part of a pair. The
is the other. Another graveyard, if you want to call it that. It was constructed by someone other than Xemnas himself.

And that's where he'll find it... That's where he'll find his other
.

Hey, you guys are looking lively.

Scram!

Didn't we catch you messing around in the Underworld? How'd a wimp like you get into Organization XIII?

I bet you can't even fight.

Yeah, but we can!

You shouldn't judge anyone by appearance.

I told them they were sending the wrong guy...

Who is this kook?

Remember, the Organization's made up of Nobodies.

Right---no hearts!

Oh, we do too have hearts! Don't be mad...

You can't trick us!

Silence, traitor.

Dance, water! Dance!

Aw... booed again."

No way!

Anyone from the Organization who'd like to be next?

Hey, Sora! Don't antagonize them!

Yeah, we gotta go help our friends out first.

Oh. Sorry.

Then let's go!

Aha! There you are!

You sure have lotsa friends to help. So, I guess we better all pull together and finish this battle for good!

Yes, Your Majesty!

Look out!

No...

Hey! You're the King's Captain! You gotta get up!

C'mon, wake up!

I'm sorry about the ice cream!

Goofy...?

Ohhhh...Goofy...

This is not happening... It can't be happening... It can't...

They'll pay for this.

Sora, did you miss me? Yuffie is on the scene!

All right! Get going!

I'll help out!

Go!

I'll help!

Hurry! Go on ahead!

Sora!

Are you okay?

Yeah, I'm fine, but...

Ohh, Goofy...

Hey, fellas!

Goofy!

Ya know, that really hurt!

Aw, Goofy!

Gawrsh, Yer Majesty, I get bumped on the head all the time.

That hurt, too.

Don't you ever do that again!

Huh?

What's with them?

Hey!

It's the guy who's NOT Ansem!

You mean it's his Nobody!

The leader of Organization XIII...

Wait a minute. Now I know!

Wise Ansem. I'm here to seek your advice.

I'm glad we have the opportunity to speak like this, my friend. I'm intrigued by your hypothesis...and I'm finding it difficult to stave off the urge to test it. Still, I'm concerned about the stability of the worlds.

Yep, that's what worries me too.

The doors that appeared. The place the Heartless seek. I fear my research may have brought this upon us...

Master Ansem. Regarding the experiment I presented the other day... With your permission, I'd like to proceed---

I forbid it!

Forget this talk of doors, and the heart of all worlds. That place must not be defiled!

But, Master Ansem! I've been thinking...

Xehanort...Those thoughts are best forgotten.

Now I remember! Xehanort! Ansem's apprentice! The leader of Organization XIII is Xehanort's Nobody!

Let's go!

Move it!

We can't let Xehanort get away!

Right!

Where's the King?

There he is!

C'mon!

Your Majesty!

Xehanort!

How long has it been since I abandoned that name...

Out with it, Nobody! Where's Kairi? Where's Riku!?

I know nothing of any Kairi. As for Riku...Perhaps you should ask your king.

Stop!

He's gone...

Sora, Goofy.

What's goin' on?

Way to fall right into their trap.

C'mon, it's a set-up by Organization XIII. Xemnas is using you to destroy the Heartless---that's his big master plan.

Xemnas?

The guy you just saw. He's their leader. Got it memorized? X-E-M, N-A-S.

Organization XIII wants to get rid of the Heartless?

Man, you're slow.

Every Heartless slain with that Keyblade releases a captive heart. That is what the Organization is after.

So what are those guys gonna do with the hearts?

I'm not telling.

Tell us!

You...you're the one who kidnapped Kairi!

Bingo. The name's Axel. Got it memorized?

Where is Kairi?

Please. Just tell me!

Look, about Kairi...I'm sorry.

Axel!

Uh-oh!

We'll ensure he receives the maximum punishment.

I don't care about any of that! Just let me into the realm of darkness, okay!?

If it's Kairi you're worried about, don't. We're taking very good care of her. Sora Take me to her.

Is she that important to you?

Yeah. More than anything.

Show me how important.

Please.

So, you really do care for her. In that case...the answer is no.

You rotten...!

Are you angry? Do you hate me? Then take that rage, and direct it at the Heartless.

Pitiful Heartless, mindlessly collecting hearts. And yet they know not the true power of what they hold. The rage of the Keyblade releases those hearts.

They gather in darkness, masterless and free...until they weave together to make Kingdom Hearts. And when that time comes, we can truly, finally exist.

What in the world do you think you're prattling on about?

Kingdom Hearts belongs to me! The heart of all kingdoms, the heart of all that lives. A dominion fit to be called Kingdom Hearts must be MY dominion!

Maleficent, no! No more Heartless!

I do not take orders from you!

Fool...

Oh no!

While I keep these creatures at bay, you devise a way to vanquish them---forever!

Maleficent...

Do not misunderstand me. I shall have my revenge on you yet.

Maleficent!

Leave! Now!

I don't take orders from you!

Sora! C'mon!

But...what about...

Now then. Where did we leave off?

Which side are you guys on anyway?

The Heartless ally with whoever's the strongest.

Yes, Sora! Extract more hearts!

No! The hearts!

Maybe everything we've done... Maybe it was all for nothing. What am I supposed to do if I can't use the Keyblade!?

Imbeciles! You can't be trusted to do anything!

Huh?

Sora! Donald! Goofy!

Relax. Those three aren't going down that easily.

The Keyblade's chosen one... He's a lucky kid.

See you soon.

I guess sometimes help comes from unexpected places.

Sure does!

Maybe everything we've done... Maybe it was all for nothing.

What am I supposed to do if I can't use the Keyblade!?

Imbeciles!

You can't be trusted to do anything!

Huh?

What's this place?

It must be the Realm of Darkness!

Kairi! Riku!

Who's there!?

What is it?

Are ya sure you wanna open...

...that?

Gawrsh, it's the gang from Twilight Town. There's Hayner, Pence, Olette...and, uh, um...

Roxas.

You know him?

No... The name just popped into my head... This is Roxas.

Are you sure you wanna eat...

...that?

Salty... No...sweet!

Not yet! I gotta look for Kairi!

Sora knows the truth now. The more Heartless that he defeats, the closer he is to becoming our perfect puppet. This new knowledge will make him that much harder to control.

What does it matter, really? Whatever his circumstances, Sora has never been able to help himself from saving people from the Heartless. It's what his pure little heart wants.

There. The dice have been cast. Things are in motion. He can't stop this.

Nothing is set in stone. If the dice aren't in your favor, you will share Demyx's fate.

The fun is in not knowing, isn't it? What is the point of betting on something if you already know the outcome?

Are you sure that defeating him won't derail the Organization's plan?

If he is to die so easily, he is of no use to us.

That's exactly what I wanted to hear. It's not in my nature to hold back.

A photo and some ice cream? Hmm. Wonder if they're some sorta clue. And who woulda left 'em for us, anyway?

Riku?

Ya think?

Just this feeling I got.

Look! We're almost there!

Hey, what if the Heartless are back again? I can't use the Keyblade---that would only help the Organization.

But Sora, I think ya have to use it. If we don't fight 'em, the Heartless'll keep on hurtin' folks.

I wonder how everybody's doin'?

Look!

Wait!

Sora!

Mulan, hey. No time to talk. We gotta catch that guy!

I'm following him, too!

Then let's go!

Looks like he got away.

How come you're after somebody from Organization XIII?

What is that?

The guy in black.

One of the bad guys!

I knew it! There's a rumor in the Imperial City about a spy in black, lurking in the mountains. I'd been up here tracking him, but when you arrived, I lost him.

Sorry!

Don't apologize. But I do wonder where he went.

Again?

Okay, first things first!

Hey! You! Quit sneaking around!

That guy... No... Why...would he? Riku?

Are you okay, Sora?

Did ya get 'im?

Hmm... Oh---he's gone.

What!? You lost him?

Anyway... What now?

I think that we better get rid of all the Heartless first.

What was that? Come on, we better get off the mountain.

Okay.

It's heading for the city! We've got to warn Shang!

Huh? Everything's fine.

Well, now... Look who decided to show up.

What? Is that a problem?

Nah!

We're just glad you're not in black cloaks.

You saw him?

Yeah---he's in the palace.

To the palace! Hurry!

Open up!

Open up!

Over here!

Huh?

Wait!

...Riku?

No. Never heard of him.

Guess it wasn't Riku.

Sorry, Sora. I can't stay. I'm worried about Shang.

Oh! Right!

Your Excellency! Shang! Something terrible has happened! We saw a huge monster fly out of the mountains and toward the city!

Ahh. So it is as the young man said. Isn't that right, Captain?

Y-yes, Your Excellency.

You see, a young stranger visited us not long ago. The Captain fought the visitor, but was quickly defeated.

To my dishonor.

It seems that young man was the one in black that I have heard whispers about.

Did he mention the name Riku?

He didn't offer his name. He was rather rude.

Rude? Then it WAS Riku!

Riku's in the Organization?

Gawrsh...

But why would he come here?

I'll check outside.

Mulan!

Shang---guard the Emperor! I'll be fine---with them!

Th-that's right!

Indeed. That is true We need not worry while you protect us.

Hurry!

Whoa!

Mulan!

Way to go!

Once again, you have served China well. It would please me to reward you.

What is it that you wish?

Well... You say a guy in black came to see you. What did he say?

That is all you request?

Yes.

Dragons have crossed our land and left a great web of paths. These dragons wield much power, and they are the source of many gifts to both man and nature. But it would seem someone of evil intent disturbed one of our dragons, and transformed it into what you call a Heartless. It is my belief that this young man came to warn me of that danger. Then, I could alert and prepare my troops.

Did you?

I was about to, but he told me the situation had changed.

He said three
had arrived, and they would take care of things.

That's gotta be Riku!

But what's he doin' hangin' out with Organization XIII?

No idea. But at least I finally know he's okay. That's good enough.

Yeah, that's good!

Now then, Fa Mulan. Do you have a request?

I'd like Shang...I-I mean... well... The Captain...

Yes, yes, my dear. What is it?

Could the Captain have a vacation, please?

I hardly expected such humble requests. In this case, I'm afraid I must refuse. Captain Li's responsibility is to protect the Emperor. And yet, Mulan... Would you like to serve alongside him and protect me?

Huh?

What?

Two reeds together are stronger than one. But the choice is yours alone.

Thank you, Your Excellency!

I hope tonight goes well.

So do I. But I wonder why he's so nervous.

The master does have his shy side, you know.

Hey there!

No Heartless and no Nobodies!

I think they're close, though...

Better watch out!

What are you so mad about?

Why are you here?

The Nobodies' world has to be out there somewhere. We're looking for a way in.

Hmph.

Tonight is very important.

Uh, maybe we came at a bad time.

Well, there's only one way to find out.

Donald!

Now then, Monsieur, Mademoiselle. Please, enjoy the evening.

And of course, our honored guests are welcome, too.

A welcome indeed.

The Organization!

You don't know when to quit.

Oh yeah! We'll show you!

Get out!

Not tonight!

I've come to take something you hold very dear.

Yes. Let your anger grow...

Beast! We have to get rid of these guys first!

Where's Belle!?

Over here!

Whew, she's okay.

Guess Xaldin didn't take anything after all.

What's wrong?

Belle? What's with them?

Maybe Belle isn't the only thing precious to the Beast.

C'mon!

What's wrong?

Please, calm down!

Calm down!? You just had to have a party, didn't you? Don't you see what's happened?

Hey. What's with you?

The rose... My rose...

What, that? He took it?

But surely, you can find another rose...

Silence! You don't know anything!

That's not fair, Beast. Don't take it out on Belle. It's not like she stole it!

I'm sorry.

You don't have to apologize.

But...

Belle... Sora... I want you to leave the castle.

Look at me. Look. This is what I am. When you first got here, I tried to change.

But I was only fooling myself. I can't be any different. I'll always be a beast. So, I should live like a beast. With no one, alone. Goodbye, Belle.

You can't mean that...

I think he's mind's all made up.

Yeah.

Look, Belle. Leave this to us. If we can get the Beast's rose back, he'll calm down.

Poor child...

How could it have come to this?

And they were so looking forward to this evening...

Now, now---no need to be so sad. Once the rose is back safely, this will all be over.

What's so special about one rose, anyway?

If the master can love and be loved in return, the spell will be broken. We'll all be human again.

Yeah. You told us.

But there is a time limit. He must find his true love before the last petal falls from that rose.

Ah, but that is not all... Over time, caring for that rose has become a cherished part of the master's daily life.

It's as though all his hopes and dreams are tied to that single bloom...

Poor Beast! Then we have to get it back.

Please do!

We can't without the Beast, though. If it's that important to him, he's got to do it himself.

Hey, Beast.

Leave me alone.

C'mon, you need to hear this. You used to be fearless. You would have given your life to save Belle. Don't you know what that meant to us? You gave us all courage. Hmph, maybe you should have kept some for yourself. I mean, are you really gonna throw your happiness away? The rose is your only hope, isn't it? Well, it's the only hope for Cogsworth and the others, too. So, don't throw away your last chance. Remember what it was like before Belle lived here?

See? You can't give up. Not now.

I know one thing.

What?

This castle belongs to me. Xaldin will never be welcome here.

So, Beast...you came after all.

You had me worried. I was afraid you'd given up for good.

What do you guys really want?

...Kingdom Hearts.

When Kingdom Hearts is ours, we can exist fully and completely. So you see, Beast---that's why we need your Heartless AND your Nobody!

Huh?

Is that...

Look! It's the rose!

Belle!

Hurry!

You! Get out of my castle, now!

With pleasure, but I'd rather travel light...

What shall I leave behind? Belle? Or the rose?

Belle!

Good one, Belle!

Where's the fun in this?

Is this the end?

Here. It's yours again.

Belle...

I know. You want me to leave the castle.

What matters is... You weren't hurt by Xaldin... You're safe. And... I'm very grateful to you...for bringing the rose back to me. Thank you.

It's the least I could do. You've been good to me. And you didn't have to be.

Listen, Belle...

Yes?

Say it!

Go on!

C'mon!

You can do it!

We have confidence.

Don't be bashful, now.

Belle, I'd like you to stay... With me... Please?

I will.

Maestro---music!

Hey, did you see the look on Belle's face when she grabbed that rose?

Yep, she sure was havin' fun, all right.

She is rather unique, isn't she?

Always ready for a little adventure.

The two of them do seem made for each other.

Yeah, they sure do!

Hey, everybody! I'm picking up a strange reading.

Are you sure? Let me see!

Look---it's all cloudy and kinda fuzzy.

Prob'ly just a glitch.

I don't know...

That's coming from the port.

Let's check it out.

Jack!

Zola! Some assistance!

That's SORA, Donald, and Goofy!

Will ye leave a mate to perish?

Aye aye...

Those pirates were cursed. I'd thought we'd seen the last of the curse of the Aztec gold... What gives?

Some scallywag must've got greedy. Oh, I see... You don't trust me, do you?

Likely a wise choice, I AM a pirate, mates.

Jack! Sora!

Elizabeth!

Some sticky business is afoot, I fear.

Wait, Jack! I need your help. The cursed pirates have returned. Will had to find out why, so he went to Isla de Muerta---to check on the Aztec treasure. I fear something's happened. You have to take me to him.

Aye, there it is. If you'll be wanting him rescued, best do it alone, lass.

Alone? Really, Jack? Sail to the island and take on the cursed pirates?

Well, if any lass could...

Are you sure he's in trouble?

No. Not certain. But he's been gone too long. I wanted to go with him, but he insisted I stay here. I can't just sit and wait! I've got to know if he's all right.

Lucky man...

Please, Jack! Take me to him!

Hold a moment. I see no profit in it for me.

I shall reward you. Of course...you do owe Will. He has saved your life before.

Right. Shall we?

Interceptor off the starboard bow!

Will!

Stop that, Jack. We've got to rescue him!

Will, wake up.

Elizabeth...

What happened?

The medallions...and...the stone chest---someone's taken them... Next thing I knew, we were attacked...but I couldn't see who it was---his face was shrouded...in a black hood.

The Organization!

We found a way out of the cave...but the villain sent a horde of terrible creatures after us... I've never seen their likes before... I think I'm the only one who made it back to the ship...

Will...

Elizabeth... I feel rather...

Our turn, guys.

You'd best go prepared. We've no idea what's out there.

Pardon me, lads and lass, but your captain will have no monsters today. Thank ye. We're turning for home.

Just like that?

Just like that!

Don't remember invitin' you.

So it was the Organization. We'll handle this!

The Darkness of men's hearts---drawn to these cursed medallions; and this Heartless---a veritable maelstrom of avarice

I wonder, are they worthy to serve Organization XIII?

And you want an answer now?

Precisely!

Oh, boy!

Not over yet!

Throw him overboard!

Aye aye!

Parley!

'Scuse me?

Barley?

It's a bit of a pirates' code. Anyone who invokes
must not be harmed 'til negotiations are complete.

This is no time for rules!

True. But as we're honorable pirates we should always stick to the Code.
All right, you. Out with it!

I surrender the chest with my humblest apologies.

Rather accommodating of you, mate. And for that you want...?

Just a few souvenirs...for the memories.

Huh?

Oh, no! We can't stop the curse unless we got all the medallions!

Our friend's about to learn what it means to cross a pirate.

Oh?

Fire!

You stole a medallion again?

Were I only that fortunate...

Fortunate?

So, uh, how come you're all skeleton-y?

Perhaps I got a tough o' somethin' from that monster what attacked us. Yet, why's the skin restin' right on you three?

'Cause we're not greedy!

What're you looking at?

That still doesn't solve the mystery.

Gawrsh... Maybe the reason we're all okay is because we're not from this world.

There must be different laws.

Yeah... we're always just passing through... Wonder when we'll see home again...

Sora...

Just kiddin' you. Lucky we didn't get cursed, huh?

Quit yammerin', mates! We've got to find ourselves a ship that'll float.

Look!

A medallion! Get it!

Three more to go!

How do you know?

A pirate must have a keen eye. Else he won't be sailin' free for very long. Savvy?

Huh? What's that?

Ahoy, mateys!

Ridiculous imitation---and yet, I'm flattered.

Jack, what happened? This is horrible!

Ah, but who's to blame for it, eh?

Well, it certainly isn't Elizabeth.

It's Organization XIII. They're the ones behind it all.

Wonder where they went.

The hooded man took the pirates and his creatures with him into some strange hole. We saw them leave from inside the captain's stateroom.

Didn't occur to you to fight them, mate?

I'm no fool. I knew I was no match for them.

That I believe.

Sora, I think we'll need your help.

Got it.

First, let's find all the medallions. Otherwise, the curse can't be broken and the creatures will remain invincible.

That's four medallions! We got 'em all!

But where's the chest?

If we find the hooded man, we'll find it.

Prob'ly in Port Royal.

Why's that?

Organization XIII is after people's hearts. So they're gonna go where there's lots of people.

They'll hurt the townsfolk?

No, they're bringin' 'em flowers, mate. I don't know who these Organizers are, but I will say they're makin' we pirates look like proper gents.

Well, Jack...then...we have to help!

Then let go and haul to run free!

Go! He's for me.

Now to break that curse!

The curse---it's gone!

Then what's this?

Aw, I understand. Jack musta been cursed by that monster, not from takin' the gold.

Oh, I've no worries, then.

It's okay, Jack. We'll just have to defeat the monster, that's all.

Get the gold!

All better.

Ah, not quite, mate.

Sora, bravo.

Just who was that chap?

He's part of an Organization that's collecting hearts. First they release Heartless into different worlds. We defeat those Heartless. Then they get the hearts. We're never gonna stop 'em like this.

What's the plan, then?

We gotta find their stronghold and finish them off once and for all.

Sailin' these waters, I've heard some tales, but not a one like this.

Is there any way we can help?

Anything at all?

There is.

It's certain we don't need the likes of that hooded fellow and the Heartless about. They'll ruin the market for us true pirates.

So that's why you went to Port Royal. And we thought you actually wanted to save everyone.

A pirate always looks to profit, Miss Swann.

Too bad. You had us going there, thinking you'd turned over a new leaf.

The question is, what's beyond the leaf? Savvy?

Oh...oh, yes---a reward. And what'll it be?

That lovely blade of Sora's.

Huh?

Okay. Sure.

Hold on! That was far too easy. What's the rub?

There, you see?

Well, you've always got the Pearl, Jack.

That I do. But someday, I'll gather a blood-thirsty crew, and come to take that blade. Chance by then I'll have the way to wield it. And if I succeed, I'll ask you two to join me. That'd be reward enough.

Done.

Maybe someday, Jack'll be able to use the Keyblade after all.

Why's that?

A-hyuck! He and Sora are kind of alike, dontcha think?

Are not!

Some say Jack Sparrow's the worst pirate ever to sail the Spanish Main.

No one could really mean that.

Right. We know he's the best.

I hope we'll get to see him again.

It's that weird reading from before. See, I knew it wasn't a glitch.

Yeah! But it's still all cloudy and kinda fuzzy.

Hmm... Well, we know one thing for sure.

What's that?

Whenever Sora, Donald, and Goofy go out and help folks, the reading gets stronger!

Gee, I wonder why.

Hey, Sora. We're gonna try to find out more about this reading.

And while we do, you fellas just keep on questin'!

We really are countin' on you, guys!

Well?

The coast is clear!

No sign of the Nobodies or the Heartless...for now, anyway.

What's that?

The Underdrome. Fiends of the Underworld once clashed there---battle after battle. But Zeus didn't like the senseless violence, so he locked the place up.

How did it get UN-locked?

Some fool must have broken the seal.

What an idiot.

Hmph.

Where are you going, Auron? We should catch up!

If you need something to do, go help your friends.

Hey.

Herc! You feeling any better?

Well...same routine. Wonderboy here thinks his hero days are over. And Phil thinks it's all in his head.

Gawrsh, Herc. We know you're a hero!

That's right...Blunderboy. How can you mope on a momentous day like today?

The Underdrome's back, and you are gonna fill the stands. After all, your fans won't settle for anything less than a certified hero.

I mean, if you're not up to it, you could always just, I dunno, LOSE?

I bet you'd like that!

Excuse me? Hey, I'm not a selfish guy. I'm not like those high and mighty snobs up on Olympus. I stand for the masses! And have I got a massive idea! The games, ladies and gentlemen...are back! Yours truly, Hades---the one and only Lord of the Dead---brings you the ultimate games, to celebrate the re-opening of the ultimate coliseum! We'll finally answer the age-old question Who deserves the title
? These games are gonna settle the debate once and for all! The winner reigns supreme. Of what? You guessed it! The Hades Cup! And I assure you that the
Hercules will be there. Otherwise...

You'll never see your girlfriend again.

Lowlife.

You're too kind, kid.

Just talk to me if you wanna enter a tournament.

His Most Perniciousness is feeling kinda charitable, so don't worry about dying or anything. You should consider yourself lucky!

And if you win, you'll get lots of fabulous prizes!

There are a bunch of tournaments, so make sure you check back often.

Yeah, it's a great way to spend some time.

I'm handling registration for the Hades Cup. Don't go to Panic for that one!

Who do we face first?

Let's see...

It's


Look! Auron's in the tournament, too!

Uh-oh! We might have to fight him in the finals!

I bet he's a real hero, huh?

Well, I don't think he's a bad guy... But you're the only hero around here, Hercules. You know that.

Maybe before... Now I'm just a washout...

Stop that!

How'd it go out there, champ?

I'm just not what I used to be. Sorry to drag you down, guys.

Don't throw in the towel yet, Herc! We need you in the semifinals!

Next are the Hades Cup semifinals. Try not to lose too quickly.

Bring it on!

We're at the semifinals...

Wak! Against
!?

Are they any good?

It sounds like they're
... but we can't chicken out now!

We made it to the finals!

If we win, we'll all be heroes!

Oh, that's why you're so happy.

We can't stay junior heroes forever, you know.

I'll try not to mess things up.

Enough already...

Look. Over there.

He's our final opponent, right?

Auron!

And you are?

Huh?

Auron...?

I must defeat you and atone for my crimes.

Hey! What was that all about?

Okay, let's review. State your crime, prisoner.

I exist. That is my crime. It is...inexcusable.

Ooh, good, very good.

What's wrong with Auron? He's never acted that way before.

Okay, so you made one lousy mistake you exist. But hey, I'm a forgiving guy. You keep your end of our little deal, and I'm willing to overlook a transgression or two.

I understand. Defeat Hercules.

And his meddling friends.

What? No, only Hercules.

Oh, don't tell me you've forgotten who's in charge?

Hercules and the other three. Are we clear?

We're clear, Hades.

Lord Hades.

Lord Hades...

Good. Now go.

So that's how he's controlling Auron!

What a jerk!

He'd probably think that was a compliment.

I can't stand seeing Auron do that lowlife's bidding... We've got to help him!

C'mon, let's go after him!

What's wrong, Sora?

Auron's in trouble! It's like Hades brainwashed him!

He's using some kind of a statue.

You know something? That sounds kinda familiar... Hades may be using the statue to hold Auron's free will hostage.

What do we do?

See if you can find that statue. It's gotta be somewhere in the Underworld.

Right. I'm on it!

Tell me you're not thinking of leaving. You've got a match coming up.

I'll fight Auron in the final. One on one.

Oh, you will?

I'll draw things out to buy you time.

But---

Just hurry back. I know you can do it!

Congratulations! You've got a deal.

Thanks.

On one condition! The Keyblader, here, and his trusty friends have to meet the winner in one final clash, whaddya say?

That'll drive the crowd wild...

It'd better. I promised the crowd the event of their afterlives.

Sucker! You know for me, the rest is smooth sailing.

Now that is entertainment!

Got it!

Huh?

What's going on!?

It is not too late! Let us turn back! Yes, but I...I cannot accept it. Where is the sense in all this? But...there must be another way! Your deaths will mean nothing! You must live!

I get it. This is what belongs in Auron's heart.

Gawrsh, he musta had a pretty rough life.

Yeah...but in the end, that's really what made him stronger.

Let's give it back!

Nobodies? Where did they come from?

Hey, go away!

Not what I had in mind, but I'll take it!

We'd better skedaddle!

Ha! Hercules must be screaming for mercy by now! What? Did you come to see Hercules lose, too?

Now! Finish him!

Auron, no!

Hey, Auron! This belongs to you!

Sora. Donald. Goofy.

Auron!

Why those little---Ugh, prisoner! What happened to our mutual agreement? I can give you a clean slate, but you gotta work with me.

Maybe you didn't hear me. This is my story, and you're not part of it.

That's it! This game is over. I've played by the rules so far. Okay, I confess! I was hoping Wonderboy would lose, but it was still a fair fight. C'mon, is that really so wrong? Huh?

Really? A fair fight?

Laugh, laugh, laugh all you want!
Because the laughing is about to stop. Wanna know why? Because now we're gonna play by my rules.

Meg!

Hercules!

Hey, I warned you right at the get-go.

You don't compete, you lose the girl.

No!

Meg! Hang on!

Looks like Wonderboy has dropped out of the standings.

Well, you've still got us to deal with!

Oh, yeah. This is gonna be good.

Hmph...That's it!

We can't win.

How come?

Because it's his Underworld.

Gee, then how do we beat him?

I think a true hero should be able to help.

But...you...

I owe you one, Hades. I didn't hesitate to give my life for Meg's. And then, I remembered

A true hero is measured by the strength of his heart.

I'll never forget that again.

Just no more crazy stunts.

People always do crazy things when they're in love.

What is so funny, you imbeciles! How dare you get a happy ending! How DARE you!

This...isn't...happening!

It's...not over...yet...

What'cha gonna do now?

I lived my life defending others. But now...there's no one left to protect. Maybe...it's time I shaped my own story.

Yeah... You deserve it, Auron---after everything you've been through.

I suppose I should thank you.

Not at all.

Fine.

I mean, sure, you could thank us a little...

You should say what you mean.

I guess I could spare a few words. Thanks for meddling.

Hey, what's that mean?

Thanks again, guys! You're the best.

Excuse up for meddling...

Aw...sounds like somebody's feathers are a little ruffled. I'm kidding. Thank you, Sora, Donald, Goofy.

So where you guys headed next?

Aw, you know... You two lovebirds seem to be getting along just fine without us hanging around.

Yeah, we gotta go.

Uh-huh, before we start meddlin'. A-hyuck!

Right.

Are you turkeys trying to put me out of a job? If you keep acing every challenge, Champ, who am I gonna train?

Aw, you can't abandon me now, Phil! I gotta be at the top of my game in case Hades shows up again.

Hey, are we true heroes yet?

Yeah! C'mon, Phil, how 'bout it?

Lemme see now... Well, you're not wise enough...

Not quite...seasoned enough...

Okay, okay, we get the hint!

Look, kid, it's not my call!

Aw, phooey.

Course if it was, you'd have no problem. I'd make you all heroes, in a heartbeat!

Really?

Say it again!

On second thought, if those are your true
faces, you still got a lotta work to do.

Hey, what do you mean?

Go away!

Phil!

Leave me alone!

See that?

Well, whaddaya know...

Oh, NO!

Wak!

You break it, you buy it! Oh! Hello there, friends.

Wow! You made out like a bandit!

Please...I am but an honest merchant. What you see is merely the reward for my hard work.

Gawrsh, they sure are nice.

And they're on sale! Interested?

No thanks. Listen, have you seen a guy in a black coat? Someone from Organization XIII?

Who me? Most certainly not...

Okay. We'll keep asking around, then.

Sora! Don't let him get away!

What's going on?

Can't believe it... That stupid peddler let Jafar out of the lamp!

Jafar!?

Give me the magic lamp, Aladdin.

And now, street rats, I bid you farewell.

Crush those urchins!

You guys better be careful.

Huh?

I'm sure Jafar wants to take over Agrabah again, but I know he's out for revenge, too.

I guess he's still sore about that whole lamp thing, huh.

Iago was there when Jafar was released. Okay, Iago. Spill it.

Hey! I told you everything I know!

This is your one and only chance, Iago. If I find out later that you've been lying or hiding things from us, we're through. I'll never speak to you again!

I can't take it! I know where Jafar is!

Where?

Uh, er, I mean, that is, I, um... Ack! I really shouldn't...

Iago!

He's in the desert ruins.

Let's get the jump on him. Lead the way!

What a disaster! We're just gonna hafta turn back.

There's gotta be a way...

Aw, c'mon, kid, that's an easy one!

Al, ol' buddy, ol' pal!

This is what having a genie for a best friend is all about! I mean, how can you leave me on the sidelines in a time like this!?

Live large! Wow 'em, Al!

Give 'em the old razzmatazz! What do ya say, kid?

Hey, Genie!

Sora!

Wanna see a little something I call
?

Uh-huh!

Take it away, Genie!

Alakaza---uh... You know? One lousy sandstorm is just too easy.

How about giving me a challenge next time, eh Al?

Now what do we do?

Nice timing, Carpet!

The game's up, Jafar!

You sure this is it?

Iago?

Ya gotta understand. It wasn't my idea! It was Jafar. He made me bring you here. You don't know him like I do! He can be VERY convincing! He said if I didn't cooperate, he was gonna---

Where is he?

C'mon Al, you've gotta forgive me.

Where's Jafar!?

Well...um, let's see...right about now, he's probably attacking the palace. I had no choice! His eyes, they got all creepy and WEIRD!

Whatever. Iago, you're supposed to be our friend. But you've been playing both sides, just to make sure you save yourself.

I knew you were still a bad guy.

I'm SORRY!

Let's go!

Get some rest, Carpet. You earned it.

C'mon, let's get Jafar!

And who asked you?

The palace is through there. Hurry!

I guess you know everything now, eh?

You can't keep shady stuff secret for long.

So true. I had just snuck into the Palace to, er, borrow some treasure when I heard this...voice. It said

I asked. The voice spoke again.
he said.
Oh! Why did I believe such a tall, tall tale? Perhaps I was under Jafar's spell. Yes! That must be it!

And I'm sure the treasure had nothing to do with it, right?

Maybe a bit. But Jafar, he never gave me a thing...

So where did you get all your treasure?

Why, the man in the black coat, of course.

Organization XIII!? I KNEW it!

The treasure was a gift, so I would tell no one about Jafar's return. He said he would destroy Jafar after turning him into a...
So there was no need to upset Agrabah.

And you bought that?

I'm a merchant. And a good one, at that. I'll buy anything if the price is right. It would have been a successful transaction if I hadn't been seen...

Oh, you're so kind...

Just wait, Jafar! You'll get exactly what's coming to you!

Indeed I will, Princess. All of Agrabah will belong to me, while you... You, my queen, shall weep at my side for all eternity!

Oh, please...

Right about now...your precious Aladdin is whispering your name, with his last breath.

What was that you were saying, Jafar?

You dare defy me! You useless bird!

Al!

Iago!

You'll all be joining him...VERY soon!

Whoa!

Run!

All shall bend to my will! The world is mine to control!

No... How can I be defeated again, by a pack of filthy street rats?

Don't mess with street rats!

You went mano a mano with Jafar, and you didn't invite me, Al?

Sorry, Genie. Things happened kinda fast.

And I had some new moves to show off, too...

But, Genie, we still need your help!

Who's gonna fix Agrabah?

Oh, yeah! One super-duper spruced-up Agrabah comin' right up! You won't even recognize the place when I'm through with it!

Just like it was, please.

Really? Same old same old?

All right.

Ooh, yeah!

Et voila! Next time let me put in a few swimming pools, 'kay?

I guess Agrabah's all right now.

Yeah! Thanks, guys.

Hey, you behave yourself, got it?

I most definitely got it! No more lookin' out for number one. I'm reformed! I wanna be a good friend, like Genie, but I can't do anything to help you. What kind of a friend is that?

Oh, no---it's not like that, Iago. Friends don't have to
stuff. As long as you have fun hanging out together, that's all that matters.

So...what do you guys do for fun?

We do this!

Uh...that's not quite what I meant...

Well, anyway...

Ow, my beak...

Gawrsh, Iago. I hope ya didn't hurt yourself.

Well...at least I can still fly.

Look out!

Ooh! Was that my cue? Am I on? C'mon, Al, lemme build a freeway or something!

Everything's fine. Don't panic...

Genie!

But I can't hold it any longer!

Oh, that's good! Sora! Donald! Goofy! You guys are too much! If you're ever in the mood for some more cosmic razzle dazzle, gimme a shout, okay?

You got it!

Well, you've done it again, Sora. Don't forget about us, okay?

I won't.

And Sora...about that friend of yours, the one you're looking for... You'll find him. Trust me.

There's nothing wrong with my design---it's flawless. There must be something wrong with the parts those imbeciles brought me. I need to find better assistants.

Huh?

Perfect timing, gentlemen! Lend me a hand, won't you? These presents must belong to Sandy Claws. So I thought I'd better return them.

You just happened to find them?

Of course, Sora. I'm finished with Christmas fantasies. You know that.

But...You thought you'd hold on to the suit?

What, this? It's just a costume. And Sally worked so very hard making it! Come on. We've got work to do!

Oh!

Wherever did you find these?

In Halloween Town. You'll be needing them for Christmas, right, Sandy?

Of course. But these are just a few of the Christmas presents that were stolen.

Stolen!?

Oh, Sandy... You don't think it was ME?

Still wearing the outfit, I see.

I just thought I'd dress for the occasion. But if you don't believe me, then we'll just have to find out who really did it!

Very well, I'll leave it to you.

All right, Sora, Donald, Goofy! We're off!

No!

This looks good.

No!

Boooring!

This one?

No!

No way!

Hey!

So YOU three took them!

Took what?

You stole the presents, didn't you!

It wasn't us!

But...

It really sounds like fun!

Run for it!

Where'd you put the presents?

We told you! We don't have 'em!

Then why are you in here!?

We're looking for parts for the experiment.

Experiment?

Dr. Finkelstein's making us a friend!

One we get to boss around!

It's true the doctor's been hard at work making SOMETHING lately...

Besides, Christmas presents are boring. Not scary or gross... So what good are they?

Yeah!

There's nothing fun here. Let's go back to Halloween Town!

So, were those pranksters responsible for taking the gifts?

It doesn't look like it.

Then that means...

Sally!

Oh, thank goodness! You're all here.

Is something wrong?

The Heartless are back in the town square. I thought you should know.

That's our cue!

Back to Halloween Town!

But wait! What about finding the gift-napper?

Actually... The Heartless were playing with some presents when I saw them...

Aha! We have our culprits!

You! You can't be here! Leave Halloween Town, by order of the mayor!

Somebody? Anybody! I'm only an elected official---I can't handle this by myself.

Sally was right. We've got to get the presents!

What a shame! It looks like it was such a nice present.

Uh, Jack---

Oh, help! Someone help me! My latest experiment is gone---it's been stolen!

I was just sitting here brainstorming, when all of a sudden I was attacked! I collapsed! And when I awoke, my experiment was gone!

Don't worry, Doctor---we know who took it.

Who!?

The Heartless.

What, those wretched things? Preposterous! This was nothing like a Heartless.

Not the Heartless, huh...

Who else could it be?

Say, I have an idea. The thief must like Christmas presents. So... We place irresistible gifts about to draw him into a trap.

And this miscreant is the same one who stole my experiment?

That's right.

How will we know for sure?

Well, now, that's easy! We'll scare a confession right out of him!

Gawrsh...

What do you say we go with Jack's plan...just for now?

Let's get to Sandy's house posthaste! We've got to make some Christmas presents, quickly!

Have you found the presents yet?

Almost, Mr. Claws!

We're going to reel in the thief with Christmas presents as bait.

Would you mind if we used your factory to create a few presents?

Presents as bait? Goodness...I don't like the sound of that.

Just this once, I suppose. It's for a good cause... All right, use the second floor. And put some heart in it.

You're going to make presents, right? You can use this machine.

Let's make it!

All done!

Not quite.

There's more?

Don't worry, I'll take care of the rest.

Did you finish making the presents?

Yup, just waiting for Jack.

So, uh, where do you think we oughta leave them?

Oh, I know a good spot. Whenever you're ready just say the word.

I'm back!

Now then, are you all set?

Yes. Let's go!

This plaza should work well for your plan. Now, Jack...what IS your plan?

I've got it all figured out.

You do...

Of course! And I also have a wonderful idea. If we catch the thief for you, I would be honored to deliver the---

And on that note, we'll be going.

What are you doing? Let me go!

Stop kicking!

It's not me, Donald.

Patience, friends.

Shhh!

I said cut it out!

Gawrsh, was that you?

How come we have to be the bait?

Good plan, eh?

Ouch!

Gotcha!

Huh?

Doctor Finkelstein's experiment did it!

We did it! The mystery is solved!

Did you catch the thief?

Naturally!

I just can't figure out why the doctor's experiment would go around stealing Christmas presents.

His experiment?

The thief! It was a moving puppet made by Doctor Finkelstein.

Hmm... The doctor's made a moving puppet? I see... He is always tinkering with things. Now listen, Jack. I'd like to thank you, and while delivering presents is something only I can do, I can give you an idea of what it's like.

Sandy Claws!

Yes, all that poor puppet wanted was a heart.

Ho! Ho! Ho!

Interesting! So the puppet wasn't stolen after all! It ran away on its own! In other words, my experiment was an overwhelming success!

Santa Claus thinks maybe it left because it was trying to find a heart.

That's quite possible. Unlike my Sally, it wasn't equipped with a heart.

But if it wanted a heart, why was it going around stealing all those Christmas presents?

Maybe because...presents are a way to give your heart to someone special.

Hmm...when you put it that way, I feel sort of bad for it.

Happy Halloween!

What a nice present.

I don't understand. There's no box! No ribbon tied in a bow!

Jack, it's not about the box or the ribbons. It's about what's inside the box!

No, Sora. What really counts---what's really special---is the act of giving the gift. To wish deep in your heart to make someone else happy.

Right...of course! Thank you, Sally, you're absolutely right. Wait! What's this? I feel so strange...so very happy!

Jack, that must be Sally's present!

Really? This wonderful feeling?

Oh, Sally! You've given me the nicest present in the world! And I've nothing to give you in return. What would you like? Just name it. Absolutely anything.

The nicest present I could ever ask for, Jack, is just to be with you.

You don't even have to ask for that.

Maybe I never gave her a real present after all.

Who?

Aw, I bet Kairi would like most anything you gave her.

I know. That's what made it so hard to decide.

It's not the gift, it's what's in your heart!

My heart...

You bet, Kairi's like Sally!

How?

Well, as long as she can be with you, what else does she need?

Oh, it's you guys. Man, we were hoping you were a meal.

Hiya!

Don't gimme any of that
stuff! Thanks to you clowns, we're back to scavenging scraps for a living.

C'mon, it's not that bad. I enjoyed that week-dead elephant we had yesterday.

Hey, how's Simba?

We gotta laugh every time we hear that dude's name.

Ooh. Say it again!

Simba!

One more time!

Simba!

Simba!

That's enough!

Go on then, see for yourself. Simba is one wishy-washy king.

Yeah, I bet about now, even some of those high and mighty lionesses were wishin' they'd gotten themselves a different king.

Gawrsh, whaddya think coulda happened?

Well, let's go find Simba and see.

Scar!?

Huh?

A ghost?

We better tell Simba about this. Wonder if he's up there...

Have you come to see Simba?

We saw Scar's ghost!

An omen like that could only be foretelling the end of our pride. Yet... King Simba won't do a thing. I guess just being the son of the great King Mufasa doesn't necessarily mean he's ready to rule the kingdom himself.

Trust me, Simba will think of something.

The time for thinking is past. We need him to take action---as his father would have done. He ruled with courage and pride. I remember it like yesterday... The mighty Mufasa...

Simba'll do all that, too. You'll see!

I'm not so sure.

Wait here. I want to talk to Simba.

You came back...

Are you okay?

You don't look so good.

Hey, Simba. Why don't we team up and do something about that Scar ghost? Seems like everybody's worried about it. So, now's your big chance to show 'em what you're really made of!

That doesn't concern you!

Sorry...

It's okay.

I just wish I knew what my father would do.

But he's not here, Simba. It's all up to you now. And that means the important thing is what you're gonna do being the king. Not what your father woulda done.

So you're saying...it's all up to me...

See, there ya go!

Exactly!

We know your dad was a great king, and all. But now it's your turn. Remember what I taught ya.
It's time to go out there and show everybody things are gonna be just fine!

Yeah, you can do it!

You gotta live for today!

And find your own path!

Live for today... And find my own path... not my father's...

That's it!

I'm glad to hear you say that, Simba.

Nala!

Promise me you'll help Simba any way you can.

As long as Sora handles the dangerous parts!

I'm counting on you, Simba...and so is our baby.

Great! Now we're going to have to babysit!

Let's go see Rafiki first. I'm sure he'll be able to tell us something about that ghost.

Oh ho ho! The king---he is ready to be king?

I think so.

Can you tell us about Scar's ghost?

Oh, yes...the ghost. A being with no body. It is created when the evil heart of Scar meets the hesitating heart of Simba.

Hesitating?

Ohhhh... You thought you were not?

Gawrsh, that ghost sounds just like a Heartless.

Hmm, I don't know.

You're right, you don't. But you do know it is upsetting. And it is upsetting the hearts of everybody in the Pride Lands. You may not know what it is, but it still IS. This world, it is full of many such things. And these things, a king must face. It is the test that has been set for you, Simba.

That's all? Come on. You have to tell us more about the ghost...

No, not today! But the hyenas in the elephant graveyard may know more. Does not matter, though. There is little the Simba of late can do.

Aw, don't say that! Not when he's ready to try!

In his head, perhaps...but what about his heart?

Forget it, Sora. Let's head for the elephant graveyard.

Whoa!

Hey you!

Aw, c'mon, can't you guys just leave us alone?

Do you three know anything about Scar's ghost?

Huh? Scar's ghost?

Maaaybe.

You DO know.

Oh no... I guess you caught us ALL.

What're we gonna do?

Tell me about Scar's ghost!

Sorrrry. We don't know nothin'.

Ooh, wait! It's coming back to me! That's the one who only hangs out around fraidy cats. Right, Banzai?

Enough!

And there it is.

Must be a fraidy cat around here somewhere!

Simba! Do something!

How does it feel to be king, hmm? Why, you must be a truly inspiring ruler by now.

After all, you ARE the son of the great Mufasa.

Where are you going?

Ah, Simba...running away as always.

Simba!

Gawrsh, Rafiki was right.

You mean, Simba's still unsure?

Seems like. Do ya think there's some way we can help?

Hmm... We should start by talking to Simba some more. Let's head back to the Pride Lands.

Where's Simba?

Well, uh...

Oh ho ho! He ran away! I knew it would not be easy for him. To face his fears, he must go somewhere where the only thing to think of is what to do, not what others think of him.

Why didn't you just say so?

But where's Simba now?

Hey, I know! He's at the oasis. It's our favorite hangout!

Got it! Let's check it out.

I'll lead the way!

Oh, no you won't! Simba'll smell you coming a mile away. And if he's smart, he'll run for the hills!

Oh...right.

Father...

Hmm. It seems even your daddy's abandoned you. How sad.

Simba!

It's no use. I'll never be the king my father was.

But Simba... That's not what you're supposed to be. You can't be Mufasa. You can only be you. Everybody believes in you as a king. They just want to see what you'll do. And if anyone's saying they liked your father better, it's because you haven't done much yet. That's all.

I know that.

Then stop moping and DO something!

I can't!

...Fine.

Let's go, Sora.

Yeah. Why stick around if he's not even gonna try?

C'mon Goofy!

The hesitant king will one day lose all his friends.

King Simba the doubtful...

Worried by a silly ol' ghost...

Ooh, Simba the do-nothing king...

No!

Try and stop me!

You did it! The ghost is gone!

We knew you could do it!

Hooray for Simba!

You know, I'm really lucky to have friends who'll stand by me...and help me see clearly. My father...wasn't so fortunate.

There you go again.

I mean... Everyone here, and in the Pride Lands, wants me to succeed. Sora, Donald, and Goofy. Pumbaa, Timon, Rafiki...Nala. You all want what's best for me. But my father always had Scar lurking behind his back, trying to cut him down. I've got to make the most of my blessings, and rebuild this kingdom.

Are you gonna say it, or do it?

Wait and see.

Simba!

Simba! Come quick! There's a bazillion ghosts of Scar haunting the Pride Lands! Everybody but Nala high-tailed it out of there. And now she needs your help.

Our little Simba...all grown up and finding his place in the world...

Nice try. You're coming, too!

We're here!

Where's Simba?

I've come back, Nala.

Get out!

Way to go, Simba!

Are you with me?

Now and forever, Your Majesty!

Simba seems fine now.

Ha! The king has returned! The Pride Lands will not forget King Simba's courage. Or the courage of those who fought beside him.

Do you think your quest will ever be over?

I don't know... But I think, as long as the Keyblade stays with me... I'll have to keep fighting.

Ahh... The struggle never ends. That is the great Circle of Life.

Never ever?

The secret to victory...is a strong heart.

Go on, go on, go---go then!

Go on, get out! Yes, yes! It is time! Your fight continues...

Till we meet again, Your Majesty.

I hope that's soon.

It will be! So long!

Oh, Sora! You're here!

Something bad has happened!


Look! The Cornerstone of Light! Before you know it, it'll be surrounded!

I think it could lead somewhere, but...

Do ya think it's connected to that door to the past?

It could be a trap made by Organization XIII.

Either way, we should probably check it out.

Aqua... Ven...

A Keyblade? Who are you? I know you. We've met before, way back when. No, that wasn't you. You're not the one I chose. Where is he? Xe...ha...nort... Is that you? Xeha...nort... Xehanort!

That's it. Your power. That's what I felt within you.

Wait a sec...I thought everything was supposed to be under control here!

Hey, look!

Must be Organization XIII again. We better go see Leon.

Bless me bagpipes! I did it! I recreated


Mmm! Can we try some?

Of course!

Oh boy! This is good!

So salty!

But sweet!

Aye. It's unique! When I was a lad, all the kids were crazy for it.

Come on in!

Wait just a second... What happened to this place?

Didn't that Heartless look like the ones from Tron's world?

C'mon, just get inside!

Hurry up, Cid!

Give me a second!

Confound it! Hurry!

Why, you...!

What's going on?

Talk about yer good timin'!

The MCP is wreaking havoc inside the computer.

Not again!

Accordin' to Leon, anyway... He went on over to Ansem's study to find out what all the ruckus was about.

Turns out the MCP is using the data in that computer to crank out Heartless.

The MCP's been messin' around with the town's control system, too.

That MCP sure doesn't know when to quit, does it?

That's a computer program for ya.

How's Tron doing?

We can't reach him. We figure he must have been forced onto the game grid.

And it don't sound like a particularly fun game, either.

Awww...

We'll go check on Tron.

Thanks, kid. We're puttin' together an MCP Eradication program. I got a hunch it's almost finished, too.

Well, I hope your hunch is right for once!

Listen, we're gonna need Tron's help when that Eradicator's completed...

Don't sweat it. We'll make sure to tell Tron!

Remember, boys---we're counting on you.

Roger!

Liars!

Wha---?

Leon doesn't have any treasure!

And we fought for you guys.

Donald...?

Well, I had to tell them something!

I don't see how we're gonna work this out.

So what should we do?

We're just going to take YOUR treasure.

But we don't have anything!

You sure?

Hmm...let's take a look!

Mm-hmm...

Oooh!

Hey, Yunie. I took a look, and sure enough...

Okay, we've decided! The Gullwings are taking all your items!

You gotta be kidding me!

Oh, foofie.

This stinks!

So not cool...

Look, sorry we tricked you, but...

Forget about it. Leon told us the whole story. He said your journey's been pretty rough.

So it wouldn't really be right if we took your things.

We'll root for you. Here, this is from us.

Bye! Good luck on your journey!

Gawrsh, it's only us!

You can't talk to Tron if this room gets taken over.

Did you check in with Cid?

Uh-huh.

And the Eradicator?

It's almost done.

Great! Say, Leon, why don't you go work with Cid? I have this place under control.

Are you sure? All by yourself...?

...Er, sorry. It's all yours.

How's Tron?

We still can't get in touch with him. Maybe you guys should give it a shot.

No, we'll go talk to him in person.

Then I have a favor to ask. When you find Tron, could you tell him to come to the I/O tower? That's where we'll upload the MCP Eradication program.

The I/O tower. Got it!

Thanks. And watch your backs.

We'll be there soon, Tron.

Gawrsh, I hope Tron's okay.

Me, too. Let's head for the game grid.

Great! The terminal works!

Let's go!

Finished?

Would be, if it weren't for the old loon's magic.

OLD loon you say!?

I'm tryin' to work here!

Oh ho-ho-ho, I'll show you who's old!

Done!

There you go, Leon.

One homemade program. A loony wizard special.

This had better work.

I'm off.

Be on your guard!

Tron!

Careful...! Watch out!

Hold on!

You really saved me.

Don't mention it!

What's going on here?

The MCP is ready to wage all-out war against the Users. What's been happening on the outside?

Well, there's this machine for making Heartless---it's gone totally berserk... The town's control system is having problems, too. But Cid's putting together a program that can de-rezz the MCP. Once we pick it up at the I/O tower, he thinks we can use it to stop the MCP for good.

Let's try it!

Great!

So who's this Cid?

He's a friend of ours. Leon, Merlin, Aerith, Yuffie... They're all on the outside worrying about you, Tron.

I must have a lot of User friends.

That program oughta be done by now, don'tcha think?

To the tower!

Let's go!

Almost there!

Outta the way!

Warning. User control is terminated indefinitely.

No good!

Leon, let me try.

This is your final warning. Stop at once.

Bon appetit! Don't talk with your mouth full.

What...what are you loading?

Nothing's come in yet.

Leon! Come onnn!

There!

All right!

What's it like?

This is very strange...

That's Merlin's magic!

Huh? There's a power booster for me! And flight routines for the solar sailer!

Meaning...we're set?

Well, like you Users say... we won't know till we give it a try!

We'll need a sailer to reach the MCP, so let's get to the simulation hangar!

You've got to keep a lookout. The MCP isn't going to just let us waltz in.

The MCP is straight ahead.

Time to settle things for good.

Who was that?

Sark. The MCP's number two.

Tenacious little bugs! You're time is up. Prepare for de-resolution!

You're very persistent, Tron.

I'm also better than you.

We...would have made a great team...

Now for the MCP!

This thing is the MCP?

That's it. Ugly, isn't it?

Tron... Don't you understand? We don't need Users. We've advanced---they're superfluous. Be a part of me, and together the world will be ours to control!

MCP. You still don't get it, do you?

Sark...

Sark! all my functions are now yours!

Eliminate all threats!

We did it!

I see Tron has a silly side, too.

I learned it from you. Of course, I do have my silly limits.

Okay, then I'll tweak your program when I get back to the User world.

You? Maybe we better not try that.

Aww...How 'bout it, guys? Singin' Tron? Dancin' Tron!

Sound good?

Yeah!

Okay, okay, fine. But before I crash---Sora, Donald, Goofy...and all the Users out there... Thank you... You really helped me. You made me so much stronger. You taught me what friendship is truly all about. And, I'll never forget it. As soon as I met you, I knew we were going to defeat the MCP and free the system.

Uhh...

Isn't this what Users do when they're sorry to say goodbye?

Uhhh...it's a first for me.

Gawrsh, Tron, it's like a promise that we'll see each other again real soon.

Okay. Well, then...

I promise.

Where are you going?

Tron...

Things are settling down in town! The only Heartless left anywhere are the local variety. And it looks like there are fewer than before.

Now if we can just get those three back in one piece...

You're here!

Welcome back!

How's the town?

A-okay!

Not a single trace of the MCP, either. Everything's back to normal. We made it.

Hey, why the long face? What happened?

Tron just disappeared.

And he promised we'd see him again...

What's happening!?

Greetings, friends. System is up, and ready for User input.

Tron!

Stay in touch.

Yeah!

Oh boy, oh boy!

Hey, stop that! It tickles!

Tron is ticklish?

How 'bout this!

Please stop that!

I think Tron's been hanging around those guys too much.

W-wait, wait just a moment. I want to show you something I dug up from the system archives.

You can see the town back when it was first built.

That's right... I remember now.

Just like the old days...

Hmm... I'd be fascinated to ascertain as to when the town got such a dreadful name as Hollow Bastion!

You know, this town had another name once.

Hm? Aerith Radiant Garden.

Say, what's wrong, sonny?

Oh, I was just thinking...and---and wondering.

You should be skedaddlin' outta here.

Why?

Why? Because it's Windsday, of course!

Windsday? Oh! Well then, happy Windsday! Now, I think I shall wish everyone a happy Windsday! Oh, bother. Let's see now. Who is
?

Ouch!

Wonder if Pooh's here...

Oh, help, help! Somebody save me!

Piglet!

Sora! Help! Please!

Hold on, little guy!

There you go!

Whew! Thank you, Sora. Oh, here comes Pooh Bear.

Pooh! You're all right!

Why, hello. It's nice to meet you. Happy Windsday.

Nice to m-meet you? But, Pooh. It's me, Piglet. Don't you remember me?

And me, too? We're friends!

We are? Hmm... It seems I can't remember.

Oh, Pooh... That's v-v-very sad!

Goodbye, Sora! Goodbye, Pooh!

Piglet...

Oh my. That does look rather fun, doesn't it?

I say, it seems we have a rather serious predicament! Sora, would you mind going after poor Piglet?

Jump down, Piglet! I'll catch you!

Oh, d-d-dear...

You can do it, Piglet! You just have to be brave!

Sora... All right, Sora. I'll t-try...

Oh, that was rather frightening. I do hope you're all right, Piglet.

Oh, P-Pooh! You remembered my name? You really, truly remembered?

Of course, Piglet. But today I think I shall call you
!

Me? Very brave? No... But it's easy to be brave when I have a wonderful friend like you, Pooh Bear!

I'm happy for you guys.

Oh, and thank you for rescuing my friend Piglet...Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Oh... Uh, sure. Don't mention it.

Oh d-d-d-dear!

C'mon!

Eeyore, Pooh. Are you okay? Gosh, that's too bad, Eeyore. After all that work...

No matter. Most likely would have fallen down anyway.

Well, I'll help you fix your house, Eeyore.

Oh, hello there, Piglet. Thanks for offerin'. Wouldn't want to spoil your fun day, though.

Well, hello, Piglet. And hello, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Pooh, this is Eeyore. You know Eeyore, don't you?

Um, I do?

What could've happened to him?

Oh, I have an idea! Maybe Pooh's tummy is so rumbly that it's making him forget. If we bring him some honey, he's sure to remember!

Well...um...I guess it's worth a try.

Might work. But prob'ly not.

First we gotta find some honey.

If honey's what you're looking for, I know just the place. Follow me.

Splendid, just splendid.

This is the place I told you about.

Wow! Look at that.

How yummy for my tummy!

But doesn't that honey belong to someone?

Oh, no! My honey! Pooh, did you eat ALL my honey!?

Oh, hello. It's nice to meet you.

What did you say?

Is that for me, too?

Oh, I was sure I'd found a safe place for it, too...

Sorry. It's our fault. We brought Pooh here.

Oh, hello, Sora... It's good to see you again.

Same here... We really are sorry.

It's quite all right. I know Pooh can't be stopped when he gets this hungry.

Pardon me, Somebody-I-Don't-Know. Is there any more?

Are you feeling all right, Pooh? Could you really have forgotten all about me? What on earth is going on?

Is there more honey? You see, my tummy's rumbly.

That's it! He's so hungry, he can't remember a thing!

Oh! We thought that, too.

Then let's stuff this bear full of honey!

I wouldn't get my hopes up.

But I thought Pooh ate all your honey, Rabbit?

Oh, I've got more. Must have emergency rations. But I hid them a bit too well.

There now, Pooh. Have just as much as you like.

Why, thank you.

Pardon me, Kind Somebody, but do you know where I might find another smackeral or two of honey?

My tummy seems to be telling me there's some honey right in there.

Bother. I'm stuck.

He still doesn't remember. What in the world has gotten into Pooh Bear?

Whatever it is, we'd better help him.

Oh, yes. And quickly, too!

Oh, stuff and fluff.

One...Two...Three!

You're okay now, Pooh.

Well, I wouldn't be so sure of that if I were you. Why, just---just look at him! He doesn't even remember who I am. Perhaps it's all this blustery wind, or---Or maybe he actually needs more honey! Or he's---he's sleepwalking and---and dreaming!

Well, if I am dreaming---which I suppose I could be---I hope that I get to the part where you invite me to lunch again very soon, Rabbit.

That's right, you're always stopping by for lunch! Wait! Pooh! You called me
!

Well, of course, Rabbit.

What about Eeyore? Do you remember Eeyore, too, Pooh?

Oh, hello there, Eeyore. It's ever so nice to see you today.

Thanks for noticing me, Pooh Bear.

Yes, hello there, Somebody-I-Don't-Know!

Well, at least you remember Rabbit and Eeyore now.

Hi!

Well, hello, Sora!

Yes, hello there, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Eeyore told me Pooh wasn't quite himself. I thought this might be just what the poor dear needed.

Yeah, I hope it'll make Pooh better!

...A Tigger's a wonderful thing! Their tops are made out of rubber! Their bottoms are made out of spriiing!

A present! For me? Why, presents are what Tiggers like best! And it's not even my birthday!

But Tigger! That's not for you!

Wait, Tigger!

Oh, dear!

C'mon, let's go after him.

You mean Pooh even forgot about ME!?

Yes, Tigger.

That bottle you thought was a present was medicine to make Pooh better.

Aw, who needs medicine!? Why, some tiggerific bouncing will jog his memory for sure!

Well, Pooh?

That looks like fun, Somebody-I-Don't-Know.

Nothing, huh? Hmm... Of course! We all gotta bounce together! That'll do the trick!

I bet you remember me now, don't you, buddy-bear!

Well, I remember that bouncing always makes me hungry.

All that bouncin' and he still doesn't remember me? Well then, I guess bouncin's not the answer. It makes a Tigger almost never wanna bounce again...

Oh, please be careful with that.

Aw, sorry little Piglet...but Pooh not rememberin' me has me confuzled. I don't even feel like bouncin'!

Oh, but Tigger. I always thought bouncing was what Tiggers did best.

Pooh Boy! You remember me! You do remember your ol' buddy Tigger after all!

That's great!

I wonder who that is. Oh, well. Perhaps...I'll remember tomorrow.

Hey, everyone... Uh-oh... Where's Pooh?

He went in there.

Do you think there might be a jagular hiding inside?

Jagular...well, now. That reminds me of when dear cousin Alphonse---

Say, why are you all sitting around here? If you're worried about that bear, let's go find him!

That's exactly what I was thinking!

Yeah, let's go!

But if there really is a jagular, we'd better think this through.

It seems we've got a bit of time. Why don't I just resume where I left off? My cousin---that is, my father's younger sister's---

What do you think we should do, Sora?

Ooh! There you are! Hey...we looked everywhere for you.

I was looking for a very dear friend that I remember I made a very important promise to.

So, did you find him?

No, I looked and looked. But he doesn't seem to be anywhere.

Oh, Pooh Boy! So there you are.

But, Tigger, did you have to bounce me so...bounce-ily?

Gosh, I thought a jagular had gotten ya!

Oh dear. I hadn't thought of that. I do hope a jagular hasn't gone and gobbled up my friend!

Now, try to remember, Pooh. Isn't Sora the one you're looking for?

Oh! The jagular!

No, it's just your tummy grumbling. You must be hungry. C'mon... Let's head home and see if we can find you some honey.

I'd like that, Sora.

Pooh! You---you finally remembered!

Remembered what, Sora?

Pooh...

I like it ever so much when you're cheerful, Sora.

Me too, Pooh.

Oh... There's a bit of a rumbly in my tumbly.

All right. Then let's go home!

Oh, bother!

Are you all right?

Sora? Is that you? Help!

So, what were you doing here?

I was thinking Perhaps there's a way to make it so you won't go away.

You mean a way to make me stay?

Yes. Would there be such a thing as a way to make it so you don't go away again?

Pooh...

Don't worry. I promise I'll come back and visit you now and then.

Could you make it
instead? That seems a bit better to me. Sora, if I go looking for you, will I find you?

I'll always be with you---right here.

You don't have to go anywhere. Just stay here, and you can see me anytime you want.

You mean I just have to stay right here?

Yep, that's all.

Would you promise?

Promise.

I promise too!

And so do Roo and I.

We sure do!

You're welcome to visit us anytime, Sora.

Thanks.

After all, I must tell you of my Uncle Albert's adventures at sea.

Guess you'll be stayin' awhile.

Goodbye, Sora.

Thanks, Gopher.

If you ever get lonely, just start bouncin' and think of your pal Tigger!

I will, Tigger!

You're leaving?

Yes. I really have to go.

Well, I won't be sad, because you'll always be right here forever and ever.

Right, Sora?

And all of you...are right here, too.

See ya!

What is Cloud doing?

Beats me.

Hmph. By the way, you three...

Who are you?

I'm not sure we should tell ya.

Well... That's an interesting sword you're carrying.

It's the Keyblade!

I see... So that's a Keyblade. And I suppose you must be its chosen wielder.

So what if I am?

I wonder if it won't change it's mind---once I defeat you. Show me your strength.

What intriguing power...

How'd you like that?

I admit you're very skilled... But apparently, Cloud is the only one who can eliminate me.

Tell Cloud to come here. Tell him Sephiroth is looking to settle things.

He's in the Dark Depths.

I see... So I guess it's time we settled this.

Cloud...

Did you give him my message?

Maybe.

Sorry to keep you, Sephiroth!

Cloud... You'll never let go of the darkness...

Shut up!

You'll never let go of your past...

Shut up!

Cloud! Get him!

Absurd. Defeating me is meaningless. You know that more than anyone, Cloud. No matter how many times I fall, your darkness keeps calling me back!

Wrong!

Tifa! Stay back!

How can I? I wanna help you.

You can't. He'll never let go of the darkness.

He doesn't have to. He just needs someone to surround him with light.

The darkness will be there, Sephiroth---but in a place you can't reach.

Is that right? Let's see what this light of yours can do.

No!

Look out!

Cloud, you can have my light.

The light doesn't suit you.

I just...don't know.

Stop!

Huh?

Where'd they go? Do ya think they made it back to their own world?

They went somewhere else... Cloud went to fight a great battle---to defeat the darkness inside him.

Gone again.

What will you do now?

Guess I'll keep looking.

Got any leads?

Don't worry... Light is easy to find. I gotta go. Here. This is for helping me out.

But wait---when did we help?

What's that? That big...thing?

Maybe that's the source of the weird reading we picked up before!

And there's something funny about Twilight Town. I'm seeing two of 'em!

Look! It's another huge energy reading! And it's coming from someplace near the town.

I dunno what's going on, fellas, but it sure looks like there's some big trouble brewing around Twilight Town!

Hey! I think we're almost there!

Huh?

What?

Gawrsh, aren't we here because of the picture?

Look, I'll show ya!

Yeah! Goofy's right!

C'mon, let's go find this mansion!

Yeah!

Hey, are you all right?

What happened?

We came here looking for Kairi. Then those white things attacked us...

You gotta be careful!

Yeah, you guys didn't have to go and do that.

Of course we did. Kairi's our friend, too, ya know.

You're right... You know, I never thought of it like that before.

Word is, this mansion gets a lot of really strange visitors.

We thought this place might be the gateway to some kind of alternate Twilight Town.

What do you mean, alternate Twilight Town?

Hey, Goofy, do you think we could see that crystal of yours?

I made that pouch myself, and I still have it. So there shouldn't be two of them here.

And this is the trophy Seifer gave you. You left it behind, remember?

It's the only one of its kind. Same for the crystals---red, blue, yellow, green---only one of each color. But you've got your own!

So...where'd you get it?

The pouch is from the King. When he gave us munny for the train ride, he gave us the crystal too.

But then...where did the KING get it?

See? There's gotta be another town out there like this one. That would explain how the King got that pouch and the crystal. Everything makes sense.

It...does?

That other town must be where whatever's missing from here went!

Like Kairi.

I get it!

Watch out!

I got somethin' to tell ya. I found out where Ansem is---Ansem the Wise! The real Ansem! He snuck into Organization XIII's stronghold.

And we've figured out where Kairi is! I'm pretty sure we're right.

But why'd you all come here?

Someone gave us a clue.

Who?

Well, Your Majesty, Sora thinks it might been Riku.

It's just a feeling I had.

Well, if that's what ya think, then it's probably right.

You mean Riku's okay!

If that's what ya think...

I've waited long enough, Your Majesty! Tell me what you know!

It's not for me to say.

But Your Majesty! Why?

I don't wanna break my promise.

You made a promise to Riku!? So he's okay! I can see him again!

Huh? Who's Riku?

My best friend.

That's IT!

Your Majesty? You got the pouch with the crystal from Riku, didn't you? And you promised not to tell, right?

Gosh, guys...

That's enough!

Yeah. Let's go!

Kairi! Riku! We're on our way!

There's gotta be a computer somewhere.

A computer... Do you think it's connected to that other Twilight Town?

It might be. And there should be a way into the Realm of Darkness there.

Riku told you that, didn't he!?

Please, Sora. I made a promise.

Aha! I knew it!

Hey! Stop pestering the King!

Right. Sorry...

There!

We found it!

How does it work?

I can handle it.

Okay... Here we go... Ah!

What's wrong?

I can't go any further without a password.

Do ya have any idea what the password might be?

Well, we only got this photo...

And the salty-sweet ice cream bar!

Yeah, the one Donald ate up.

It was in the box right next to the photo.

Hey, that's it! Ansem the Wise loved ice cream!

Okay, what's the name of the flavor?

The name of the ice cream was...Sea-salt ice cream.

It worked!

Let's go!

We'll be here to hold down the fort.

Say hi to Kairi!

You bet!

Are we back in the same place?

Look!

This is the other Twilight Town. Roxas's Twilight Town.

There's gotta be an entrance into the dark realm somewhere. Let's split up.

There...

This is it.

What is this place?

Well, which way should we go?

Riku! Kairi!

It's no use!

Don't stop moving, or the darkness will overtake you!

Get goin'!

Why?

Don't ask. Just do it!

You okay?

I kidnapped Kairi, but she got away from me. After that, Saïx caught her. He's a member of Organization XIII. Saïx. Got it memorized? Now go save her!

Leave us alone!

I think I liked it better when they were on my side.

Feeling a little...regret?

Nah...I can handle these punks. Watch this!

Whoa!

You're...fading away...

Well, that's what happens when you put your whole being into an attack. You know what I mean? Not that Nobodies actually HAVE beings...right? Anyway, I digress. Go, find Kairi. Oh, almost forgot... Sorry for what I did to her.

When we find her, you can tell her that yourself.

Think I'll pass. My heart just wouldn't be in it, you know? Haven't got one.

Axel, what were you trying to do?

I wanted to see Roxas. He...was the only one I liked... He made me feel...like I had a heart. It's kind of...funny... You make me feel...the same... Kairi's in the castle dungeon. Now go.

Axel...

This leads to...

Aw, come on! Let's get going!

The house is looking pretty empty, huh? I thought I'd get a little enjoyment watching Axel throw one last tantrum, but he went a lot quieter than I thought.

Perhaps he was ready for it. Perhaps he put his existence on the line and won what he'd been longing for.

Wait a minute. How would that even be possible? We don't exist, remember? What you're saying goes against the laws of nature.

Then perhaps he bet his NON-existence. Either way, he came out a winner. Oh, Axel. A grifter to the end.

That's absurd. He won nothing and is nothing. He couldn't stand the emptiness of being without a heart, and that led to his demise. He was foolish and weak.

But...

Weakness has the power to awaken that which is dormant. It is clear that through his actions, however foolish they may have been, Axel has touched Sora's heart. Perhaps HE will soon awaken.

Axel said Kairi's in the dungeon.

Then we better find a way to get to that castle!

Sora!

Donald! Goofy!

A Keyblade?

Wh-who are you?

Someone from the dark.

You can't be Riku?

Riku? ...I defeated a Riku once.

You what!?

Tell me... Tell me why he picked you!

I see. That's why.

What!?

You seek answers.

You feel nothing. Nothing is real. I can give you purpose.

Roxas.

That is right--the new you.

Look who's finally awake.

Axel.

Or...maybe I have it wrong. Might be time to sleep. Soon we won't be able to talk like this anymore.

Does that mean it's time for me to go back to where I belong?

You know, I've been thinking about something Naminé said. Roxas... are you really sure that you don't have a heart? Is it possible that we all have one? You, me, her... Or is that just wishful thinking?

I don't know.

I can't...just look inside.

Y-yeah, I guess not...

But I figure...if there is something in there--inside us--then we'd feel it, wouldn't we? And if so... No... Nevermind.

C'mon. Don't leave me hangin'.

Sora will find the answer we're looking for. I know he will. Because, he's me.

True enough.

Man, I miss the old times. Still got it memorized? The day we met, when you got your new name, you and I sat right here and watched the sunset.

Yeah. This place is home. Me... Hayner, Pence, Olette... We've shared a lot of adventures.

You'll see them again. I know you will.

Yeah, you're right. Well, I should go.

Sora's waiting for me.

Yeah, I suppose he is.

Man, this is some good ice cream, huh?

Take care, okay?

Right back at ya...buddy.

You make a good other.

You make a good other.

Are you okay?

What...just happened?

Gawrsh, I dunno. You just disappeared. Then me and Donald had to fight some Nobodies.

Oh. He said... he defeated Riku...

Who said that?

That guy. In the black coat.

But nobody could defeat Riku.

Y...Yeah, you're right.

A black coat means Organization XIII. He musta been tryin' to trick ya.

Yeah, that must be why we didn't see him!

Huh?

You must be tired, Sora.

C'mon, let's just find a way to get into that castle!

Dead end?

There's gotta be a path somewhere.

What are you going to do with us?

You're the fire that feeds Sora's anger.

No... Sora's in danger because of me...

This way!

Who---?

Believe in yourself. C'mon, hurry!

Kairi... We're almost there.

Kairi! Where are you?

Shhhh! Remember where we are! This is their stronghold!

Wait! Your Majesty!

Be careful! I think we got company!

Naminé... There you are.

Naminé...?

Kairi. I'm afraid leaving is not an option.

I'll take you to see Sora.

You don't want that?

I do. More than anything. But not with you around.

If I had a heart, this would be where I die of laughter.

You... Didn't Roxas take care of you?

You can take it from here, Riku.

Riku!?

Wait!

Riku...you're really here...

Sora... You've done well.

Where's Kairi?

Who knows? I expect she's catching up with her friend from the darkness.

What do you mean!?

She doesn't need you anymore.

I'm supposed to believe that?

Well, you don't have to... But you can believe this. Organization XIII has no further use for you... Just look there.

Our Kingdom Hearts... Thanks to you, we've collected countless hearts... Can you hear their euphoria? Now, all they need is one more helping from the Keyblade bearer!

We gotta fight!

But---Kingdom Hearts!

Sora!

Sora! It's really you!

Kairi!

You leave Sora alone!

Sora---!

Take it.

This time...I'LL fight. You know Sora's completely hopeless without us! C'mon, Riku!

Well, well. Will the intrusions never end?

Why, Pete...this castle is perfect. Perhaps we should...acquire it.

Well, the setup is...kinda nice, I guess, but...what about all the Heartless? This in-between world---it's way too close to the darkness! They ain't gonna listen to us here!

Once again, you underestimate me.

It's been too long, my friend.

Ansem the Wise. Why didn't you come to me before things got so bad?

Xemnas, the Organization's Superior, is the Nobody of Xehanort, my foremost apprentice. The burden was mine to bear.

Is that all?

I won't deny there was more. I was...obsessed with thoughts of revenge. My apprentices stole everything precious to me---my research, and my pride.

I can't help you with revenge.

I know. Riku's told me a thousand times.

Where is he?

He must be with his friends by now. Riku was a great help to me. I found him wandering the darkness, after you and he lost track of each other.

Gosh, we didn't lose each other exactly. Riku left...well, 'cause Xehanort's Heartless was still inside his heart, troubling him. And he sure must've been suffering. But what I don't understand is why he looks like that now, when he's still Riku at heart...

I am to blame. When I met Riku the first time he still had the appearance of a boy. Probably because he had such a strong heart. I asked him to find a young man named Roxas from Organization XIII, and bring him to me. When I told him it would help Sora awaken from his slumber, Riku left without a word. He fought Roxas. And I can only surmise Riku lost that fight. Riku must have realized then to fight in the realm of darkness, he would have to immerse himself in that same darkness. And when he did...you saw what became of him. When Riku brought Roxas back to me, he was introducing himself...as Ansem. If that was what it took to awaken his friend, he was ready to live in darkness. Riku was the victim of my revenge. ...Oh, how my heart ached. I could only laugh to hide my shame.

I guess it musta been after that when I saw Riku again. He said he wanted to help Sora...but he made me promise--- Promise that Sora wouldn't ever find out about what happened to him while he was out in the darkness.

My friend, the time has come. I must make amends to these young people.

Get off!

What's going on!?

Have you been a good boy?

Show yourself!

Oh, it sounds like you haven't. Sora! Roxas!

Roxas? Hey, did he just call me Roxas?

You've really put Organization XIII in a pickle. I guess that must be why the Keyblade chose you. But MAN, did it pick a dud this time. You don't look like you're half the hero the others were.

Are you done rambling?

Rambling? As if! All I'm trying to tell you, traitor, is that your time is up!

Here he comes!

You really shouldn't have betrayed us.

Gotcha now!

Clever little sneak!

I lost? Me?

Why did you call me Roxas?

Wouldn't you like to know...

Hey! Hold on!

Sora! It's Kairi!

Uh-oh, they need our help.

Sora and Riku are together. We have no part to play here.

Gee, I wonder if Riku will ever change back...

Riku chose that form so he could use the power of darkness. It won't be easy.

Kairi, we're on our way!

Yes...Kingdom Hearts... Rejoice, and feast on these hearts we offer! Shine your pale light on this empty realm... Share your power with all Nobodies!

Xemnas. Is Kingdom Hearts ready?

Very soon.

Then, I can end this charade?

Indeed.

How I've waited to hear that.

Kairi, you were great!

Oh?

You are different, Kairi, but I'm just glad you're here!

You and Riku never came home, so I came looking for you.

I'm sorry.

This is real...

Wait, Ansem! I mean, Xehanort's Heartless...

I never thought for a second that I'd ever see YOU again. Just thinking about all the things you did makes me really mad. But... But you saved Kairi, right? I have to be grateful for that... Thanks.

Riku, don't go!

Huh?

Kairi, what did you just say?

Riku.

I'm no one---just a castaway from the darkness.

Sora, come here. Say something to him.

Here. You'll understand.

Close your eyes.

Riku... It's Riku. Riku's here...

I looked for you!

C'mon, Sora. You've got to pull it together.

I looked everywhere for you!

I didn't want you to find me.

But it was him that was helpin' us, wasn't it?

Huh?

Those clues we kept finding. That musta been Riku.

I was starting to worry you guys weren't ever gonna catch on. Sora never did pick the brightest friends.

What do you mean by that!?

Why didn't you let me know you were okay?

I told you. I didn't want to be found. Not like this...

I couldn't. I fought with Ansem. With...Xehanort's Heartless---when it invaded my heart, and I won. But to use the power of darkness, I had to become Ansem myself.

Does that mean...you can't change back?

This battle isn't over. And until it is, I still need the power of darkness.

Then...let's finish it. You're still Riku, no matter what!

So how 'bout it Think we can handle one last rumble together? The King's waiting!

Yeah! Let's get going!

This spot should do.

What's this gadget for?

It's a device to reclaim Kingdom Hearts and encode it as data.

Not sure I get it.

I do not claim to know the outcome of this venture, either. After all...Hearts are unpredictable.

What's that?

It's the King and DiZ---I mean, Ansem the Wise. They must be higher up. We better hurry.

You!

I'd rather we just skip the formalities. The first to run out of time is the loser.

You play the game quite well.

How could you...Roxas...

That's SORA!

You okay?

Yeah! No worries. Let's keep moving.

I can sense Saïx. He's using something to boost his power. If we can figure out his power source, we may be able to use it, too.

Only you could have made it this far in one piece...Roxas.

That's getting really old!

Yeah! He's Sora!

Different name, same fate.

Do you feel it, the moon's power? Moon, shine down!

A heart... if I had a heart...

Why... Kingdom Hearts... Where is my heart?

I don't get it. Why's everybody been calling me Roxas?

Because, Sora. Roxas is your Nobody.

My...Nobody? But that's crazy, I never turned into a Heart...... Oh, right.

It was when you came to rescue me, remember?

Xemnas was the one who found Roxas. He could use the Keyblade because he was your Nobody. That's why Xemnas brought him into the Organization--- But Roxas betrayed them. After that I fought him because I thought it would help you wake up. I lost, but the next time we met I made sure I was the stronger one.

Why don't you quit?

Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger than that.

Huh? Get real! Look which one of us is winning.

So it's true. You really are his Nobody. Guess DiZ was right after all. Roxas What are you talking about? I am me! Nobody else!

How many times do I have to beat you?

All right. You've left me with no other choice.

What?

I have to release the power in my heart--

The dark power that I've been holding back.

Even...if it changes me forever.

I have accepted it.

He could feel Sora.

Oh, he told you how he
did he? Ridiculous. A Nobody cannot feel anything.

If he had met Sora, things might have been different.

Maybe I didn't need to fight him after all. I think he left the Organization because...he really wanted to meet you.

Roxas...I wish I could meet him, too.

All right. Let's go.

Ansem?

I'm a fool. I've spent years studying the workings of the heart. Yet it seems I still haven't learned a thing!

What d'ya mean?

The process of encoding hearts is incalculable. The inhabitants of my Twilight Town were data created from real hearts. I was convinced that they would think and behave the way I had envisioned---but I couldn't have been more wrong. A heart is so much more than any system. I saw it when Roxas and Kairi crossed paths. I knew. But I was too stubborn to accept it. It's always the same. I try to wrap my mind around things my heart already knows, only to fail. While I was trying to bring Sora back, I had so many plans in store. But once Sora was an acting force, they fell apart. All my research amounted to nothing, compared with that one boy's heart.

Ansem! The machine!

All the more proof that hearts cannot be contained by data. Run, my friend! It's going to self-destruct, and anything could happen!

But...

Your Majesty!

Sora, the rest is up to you... And Roxas--- I doubt you can hear me---but...I am sorry.

Ansem!

My heart is telling me what I must do. Please allow me to do what it says!

No!

Riku!

His heart's decided. We can't change that.

I was wondering who would dare interfere with my Kingdom Hearts. And look---here you all are. How convenient for me. Ansem the Wise... You look pathetic.

Have your laugh. I deserve as much for failing to see you for the fool you are.

Students do take after their teachers. Only a fool would be your apprentice. After all, none of this would have happened without you. YOU are the source of all Heartless. It was your research that inspired me to go further than you ever dared.

I admit...my disregard brought chaos to more worlds than one. But what were YOU seeking? You erased me from the world, only to take my name and continue research better left forgotten... Is this the answer you've been looking for?

All that and more. I'm carrying on what you yourself began, and I'm creating a brand new world, one heart at a time. I thought you'd praise me, but all you ever do is hold me back. I understand, though. Unlike me, you have a heart. And you're powerless to control it. Consumed, by the jealousy you feel toward the student who surpassed you.

Xehanort. Foolish apprentice of a foolish man. You have surpassed nothing---only proved how little we both know. We may profess to know the heart, but its essence is beyond our reach. We're both ignorant---as oblivious as when we began. I'm afraid that any world you try to create... Any world of yours...would be an empire of ignorance. That is why you and your creation are destined to fall!

We've said enough! Riku, you know what to do! King Mickey, my friend, forgive me! Farewell!

Riku?

Riku!

Wow!

Riku!

Ansem did say
...

Riku, you gonna take that off?

Oh...

What was that?

His eyes couldn't lie.

Lie? And just who were you trying to fool? Huh? Huhhh?

Myself.

Riku... C'mon, man! Why did you try to do so much on your own?

You got friends...like us!

Have you forgotten? I'll tell you why. 'Cause I'm not a total sap like you.

Say that again!

Uhhhh-oh!

What should we do, Riku?

We must defeat Xemnas. He's the Organization's last survivor.

Right!

C'mon!

Sora! Riku!

There's gonna be no end to this.

Together we can stop 'em!

Be gone from here! Leave these creatures to us!

But there's no way we can take 'em all!

I will be sending them after Xemnas. Or, perhaps, you would rather fight them yourself?

Frankly my dear, I'd rather...RUN!

Off with you then!

Well, if it ain't the boat-boy King.

Time to weigh anchor, Captain Pete!

What, like
? I don't think so!

Sora!
! Do not forget---when I've destroyed them all, this castle shall be mine!

Now lookie here. Opportunities like this don't come along every day, ya know.

Bring 'em on!

We gotta hurry.

But...

They're doing what their hearts command. We can't interfere.

Ohh...my Kingdom Hearts...ruined. Now I'll have to start all over again. Warriors of the Keyblade!

Go forth, and bring me more hearts!

No!

Denizens of light, answer this Why do you hate the darkness?

Aw, we don't hate it. It's just kinda...scary. But the world's made of light AND darkness. You can't have one without the other, 'cause darkness is half of everything. Sorta makes ya wonder why we are scared of the dark.

It's because of who's lurking inside it.

Then allow me another question. You accept darkness, yet choose to live in the light. So why is it that you loathe us who teeter on the edge of nothing? We who were turned away by both light and dark---never given a choice?

That's simple. It's because you mess up our worlds.

That may be... However, what other choice might we have had?

Just give it a rest! You're Nobodies! You don't even exist! You're not sad about anything!

Very good. You don't miss a thing. I cannot feel---sorrow... No matter what misery befalls the worlds. No matter what you think, what you feel, or how you exist.

Guys!

So... it wasn't a fallacy...

Sora! Where are you?

Sora, answer me!

You're okay!

Where's Xemnas?

What!?

Hear me, Kingdom Hearts! It seems we must begin anew. Ah, but know this I will give to you as many hearts as it takes. Mark my words! You can no more be complete without me than I without you. Heed me, Kingdom Hearts! Lend me your power, so that we may be complete! The power to erase the fools that hinder us.

Xemnas! No!

Hearts quivering with hatred...

Xemnas! Don't!

Hearts burning with rage...

You'll never win!

Hearts scarred by envy... That fool Ansem said the heart's true nature was beyond his understanding. But it's not beyond mine! Hearts are the source of all power!

Xemnas! You can't hide from us!

We're not gonna let him get away now!

Look at that!

What's goin' on?

Kingdom Hearts...

Let's go. Xemnas must be inside.

The worlds gave us this doorway. They want us to be the guardians of their destiny!

Once we go through, there's no turning back. It's victory...or oblivion. So, Sora...are you ready? Do you remember before? We stood facing each other on opposite sides of that door. Now we stand side-by-side. Let's go home together this time.

Beyond this door is the beginning of the end of your journey. Are you prepared for what lies ahead?

Let's end this!

Get ready, Xemnas! It all ends here!

So...it seems your hearts have led you to obliteration. Perhaps it doesn't pay to be too loyal to one's heart. I will have to be sure and remember that.

No!

We can take him on our own!

Cursed fools!

I need...more rage.. I need more...hearts...

Xemnas. There's more to a heart than just anger or hate. It's full of all kinds of feelings. Don't you remember?

Unfortunately...I don't.

Gosh, you all did great!

You're coming back with us, right?

I had given in to the darkness.

Riku!

How'm I gonna face everyone?

Like this!

Hurry!

I'll open a path!

You don't belong in the dark realm anymore, Riku.

How do we get out of here, Your Majesty?

Who did this?

Well, I'm not sure. But we'd better hurry and get through.

Wait for me!

C'mon!

Thank you, Naminé.

Sure. See? We meet again, like we promised.

Huh?

You said we'd meet again, but when we did, we might not recognize each other.

I did, didn't I?

But I knew you.

Mmm...it's strange.

I think I understand. I see myself the way you remember me. And you see yourself the way I remember you.

I always though Nobodies were doomed to fade back into darkness...

Yeah, but you and I didn't. We got to meet our original selves.

So, we can be together again!

Right. Anytime Sora and Kairi are together.

We'll be together every day. Right, Sora?

Uh...yeah!

Look sharp!

Huh?

Don't worry. You're all still you.

Hey, let's go home!

Riku... C'mon.

Yeah.

Sora! Riku!

What?

Riku!

Sora!

Hey, Riku?

Yeah?

I wanted to thank Naminé, but I couldn't bring myself to say it. Not until everything was back to the way it was before.

Don't worry. We'll make that happen. Once this is over, you can thank her all you want.

Yeah!

Nothingness is eternal! Riku...are you sure you're not jealous of Sora?

Embrace nothing! Hearts are power!

Heroes from the realm of light... I will not allow it to end this way---not yet. If light and darkness are eternal, then surely we nothings must be the same... Eternal!

You're right, light and darkness are eternal. Nothing probably goes on forever, too. But guess what, Xemnas?

That doesn't mean YOU'RE eternal!

No more eternal than that radiance of yours...

Anger and hate are supreme.

Can you spare...a heart?

Sora!

Guard!

Is that all you got?

There is no such thing as light!

Sora!

Riku!

Riku!

Cursed...Keyblade...

We did it!

I wouldn't be too sure of that.

Sora... I can't...

Don't say another word! It's not over. It's just not.

How can you say that? Even if we could go on...look where we are.

Aw, c'mon, Riku. You've been hanging out in darkness too long. You gotta try and think positive!

Sora?

Hm?

You lead.

Got it.

You know... I always figured I was better at stuff than you.

Really?

Are you mad?

No. I kinda always thought you were better at everything, too.

Riku---look. What's that light?

End of the road?

Yep.

Put me down. I can walk.

You know...maybe the darkness has gotten to me, too.

Riku!

This world is perfect for me. If this is what the world really is...just this, then maybe I should fade back into darkness.

Riku...

If the world is made of light and darkness... We'll be the darkness.

Yeah. The other side...the realm of light is safe now. Kairi, the King, and the others are there.

That's what I mean. Hey, Sora... Could you help me? I want to get down to the water.

At least the waves sound the same.

What I said back there...about thinking I was better at stuff than you... To tell you the truth, Sora... I was jealous of you.

What for?

I wished I could live life the way you do. Just following my heart.

Yeah, well, I've got my share of problems, too.

Like what?

Like...wanting to be like you.

Well, there is one advantage to being me... Something you could never imitate.

Really? What's that?

Having you for a friend.

Then I guess...I'm okay the way I am. I've got something you could never imitate too.

Sora? I think it's for you.

Thinking of you, wherever you are.

We pray for our sorrows to end, and hope that our hearts will blend. Now I will step forward to realize this wish.

And who knows Starting a new journey may not be so hard or maybe it has already begun. There are many worlds, but they share the same sky---one sky, one destiny.

Light.

The door to light...

We'll go together.

Yeah.

Sora! Riku!

W-We're back.

You're home.

Nothing's changed, huh?

Nope. Nothing will.

What a small world.

But part of one that's much bigger.

Yeah.

Hey Riku...what do you it was---the door to the light?

This.

This?

Yeah. It's always closer than you think.

Sora! Riku!

Hey, what's up?

Look.

From the King?
