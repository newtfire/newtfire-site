      <speech speaker="Katara">Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days:
            a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom,
            Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the
            Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when
            the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation
            is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe
            journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my
            brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn
            into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still
            believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.</speech>

      <description>As the title card fades, the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before
                panning slowly to the left, revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water
                as the shot rotates, moving over a large snow-covered area where the untouched
                blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps. The shot fades to another shot
                of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky
                beyond. As the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise, a small canoe
                comes into view, its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it.
                The shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it, providing a side
                angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel.
                Sokka, a teenage boy, and his younger sister, Katara, a teenage girl, are sitting in
                the boat; Sokka holds a spear at the ready, while Katara simply stares into the
                water on the other side of the boat. The shot cuts to an overhead view, revealing
                that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of Sokka, who is focused
                on it, following its every movement. Cut to a frontal view of him.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">It's not getting away from me this time. <charAction>Close-up of Sokka as he grins
                confidently over his shoulder in the direction of Katara.</charAction> Watch and
            learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot pans quickly from Sokka to Katara, who seems indifferent to his
                claim and turns back to her side of the boat again. Her expression changes to
                surprise; as the shot jumps behind her, looking down into the water over her
                shoulder, another fish quickly swims by her, close to where she sits. She shoots a
                quick glance toward her brother, removing the glove from her left hand. She
                stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish, taking a deep breath. Her look
                is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion
                with her wrist, moving her hand up and down.</description>
      <description>The shot widens out; Sokka, still focused wholly on the fish in front of
                him, is completely unaware of what is happening behind his back. As Katara continues
                to move her hand, the water in front of Katara, just in front of the shot, starts to
                ripple. Suddenly, a bubble of water rises up from the ocean containing the newly
                trapped fish.</description>

            already smell it cookin'.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Behind Sokka, Katara is still making circular movements with both her arms,
                suspending the bubble of water that holds the fish in the air and moving back and
                forth. The camera cuts to her face, contorted slightly by the focus it takes to
                control the water.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The bubble containing her fish slowly drifts around her to hang over Sokka,
                who is still oblivious. As the bubble hovers over his head, Sokka raises his spear
                to strike the fish he was following. He bursts the bubble of water with the blunt
                end of his weapon, causing Katara to lose control of the water; it rains down on
                Sokka, soaking him.</description>

      <description>As Sokka lets out a gasp of discomfort, the fish tumbles through the air
                and Katara follows its arc with her eyes as it flies over her head and splashes back
                into the sea. Sokka rounds on his sister, placing his spear perpendicular to the rim
                of the boat as he yells irately. The shot cuts to a close-up of him.</description>

                wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her, wringing the water out of

            I'd keep my weirdness to myself.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically, arms still
                crossed.</charAction> You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at
            myself every time I see my reflection in the water!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Near the end of her response, Katara smiles smugly at her brother; as the
                shot cuts to him, he is flexing at his reflection in the water and grinning
                confidently. His happy look vanishes upon hearing his sister's remark and he turns
                around slowly, meaning to face her. Before he can say anything, however, the canoe
                suddenly shudders. As they both try to keep from falling over, Sokka whirls around
                toward his end of the canoe, a frantic look on his face.</description>
      <description>The camera cuts to a far view of the canoe, which pans up as the boat moves
                away from it. The boat is caught in a rapid current, which is pulling it swiftly
                toward a jumble of large icebergs which block the end of the narrow passage formed
                by the towering walls of ice. Sokka paddles the boat in an attempt to stay clear of
                any floating chunks of ice. He manages to gain just enough speed to keep the boat
                from being crushed by two icebergs which slam together behind the boat. A series of
                shots follows: the canoe moving through the water as Sokka rows furiously; a
                close-up of Sokka's head; and a frontal shot of the canoe as it is nearly pinned by
                a number of smaller chunks of ice. Cut to Katara's face, both her face and voice
                full of panic as she yells commands to Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Watch out! Go left! Go left!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot shows an overview of the ice floes moving closer together in front
                of the boat, narrowing their path. The boat manages to stay clear of some of the
                icebergs, but it veers to the right with the current and becomes pinned by three
                large chunks of ice. As the canoe is completely crushed by the ice, Katara and Sokka
                throw themselves from the canoe and onto one of the floes; Katara nearly slides off
                the other side into the water, but comes to a halt at the floe's very edge. As she
                raises her head, looking around, the shot zooms out to reveal the siblings are
                floating on one floe among dozens.</description>
      <description>Katara, shuffling on her hands and knees, moves away from the rim toward
                the middle of the floe, sitting next to her brother. His spear is embedded
                point-first in the ice just behind him.</description>

            ice.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot cuts to a wide shot of the two on their floe; among the large
                icebergs and tiny floes surrounding them stands a massive, towering shard of ice,
                its craggy peak rising high above the siblings. Katara gets on her feet again,
                facing Sokka so that the pointed iceberg is behind her.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a close-up of Katara's face as it contorts with fury. The shot cuts
                to a side view as Katara points accusingly at her brother, who makes no movement as
                she screams her disgust at him, the floe bobbing lightly up and down.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You are the most sexist, <charAction>She brings her hands up to her head and swings
                them back down and behind her in her rage; the movement creates a small wave of
                water behind her.</charAction> immature, <charAction>Hands raised back to her
                head.</charAction> nut brained ... <charAction>Swings her arms back down again,

                upward, a short jet of water shoots upward as well.</charAction> to be related to
            you!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She swings both her hands back forcefully once again and her unconscious
                waterbending hurls a wave directly into the towering iceberg behind her; with a
                loud, splitting crack, a hooklike fissure arcs up its surface and out its side,
                leaving a spray of ice where it ends. Sokka, who wears a somewhat disinterested
                expression, glances briefly in his sister's direction and sees the iceberg; after a
                short moment, he does a double-take, his expression morphing into one of terror. The
                shot cuts to show Katara's outburst from behind Sokka; as she continues with her
                verbal outburst and arm movements, little chunks of ice from the iceberg splash into
                the water, unheard and unnoticed by Katara.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Ever since mom died, <charAction>Points to herself.</charAction>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She emphasizes the last words with a strong swing of her hand, waterbending
                and deepening the crack in the iceberg. Sokka's terror deepens.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Pointing to the iceberg behind her, his voice subdued by
                fright.</charAction> Uh ... Katara ...</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Close-up of a rage-fueled Katara as she continues her outburst, a finger

            pleasant!&gt;
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As she yells out that last word, she unconsciously waterbends once again,
                causing two new splits in the chunk of ice.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>In a screeching voice, his eyes open wide in fear.</charAction> Katara,

      <speech speaker="Katara">No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Her last movement is her most agitated and it creates a huge wave which,
                when it impacts the iceberg, sends a number of fissures to snake their way up the
                iceberg; one of them reaches the top of the iceberg, splitting it completely in
                half. Petrified, Sokka gasps for air, and it is only now that Katara turns to look
                behind her. She gasps and the shot cuts to the iceberg; the two halves begin to fall
                away from each other and the siblings can be seen through the widening space between
                them. The shot jumps to the siblings' backs as the two halves collapse into the
                water; a wave larger than any Katara cast at it radiates outward toward them and
                they are thrown to the ice as it pushes their floe backward.</description>
      <description>As the waves subside, the shot cuts to a head-on close-up of the siblings,
                their heads slightly over the edge of the ice. Sokka, holding a protective arm over
                Katara, turns his head toward her.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front
                of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue. An
                overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within. Cut to
                the head-on close-up as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the
                edge, just as a large, roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the
                water.</description>
      <description>The shot jumps behind Katara and Sokka as an iceberg rises above the
                surface, revealing its massive form to be the source of the glow. The crashing waves
                generated by the iceberg's rising push the floe backward as the berg itself rocks to
                one side, before coming to rest with its rounded dome exposed above the water.
                Mesmerized by the iceberg, Katara strays closer and stares at the iceberg; behind
                her, Sokka halfheartedly stretches out his hand, as if to hold her back. A few cuts
                ensue: the iceberg from behind Sokka and Katara; Katara's face as she stares at the
                object; and a shot of the iceberg itself, revealing a human shape within below a
                larger, indistinguishable mass. The human figure, perched in lotus, has glowing
                arrows on its head and hands. Close-up of Katara as she raises an eyebrow in
                confusion. The shot cuts to a closer view of the figure in the ice, its features
                accentuated by reflected light, revealing it to be a boy. Suddenly, the boy opens
                his eyes, the same brilliant light emanating from them, eliciting shocked gasps from
                both of the siblings.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">He's alive! We have to help!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Before Sokka can grab it, Katara grabs Sokka's club out of its sheath on
                his back and pulls her hood over her head, heading in the direction of the strange
                boy sealed in the iceberg. Sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold
                Katara back, though she is already running across the ice.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Katara, get back here! <charAction>He grabs his spear from the ice and runs after
                Katara, who is already at the ice's edge.</charAction> We don't know what that thing
            is!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on
                five tiny chinks of ice; Sokka, close behind her, does the same. Reaching the
                iceberg first, Katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with Sokka's club. On her fifth
                strike, the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind, which escapes
                from within the iceberg, throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome.
                Fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and, in a massive outward
                explosion, the entire orb of ice destroys itself. A beam of light bursts from the
                core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky. The camera shows the iceberg from the
                shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light. The scene switches to a group of
                tiger seals, who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of
                light.</description>
      <description>Cut to a Fire Nation ship, where a boy in a Fire Nation military uniform
                stands on the deck, gazing at the light. His ponytail flutters in the
                wind.</description>

                airbending.</charAction> I don't want you to get too excited over nothing.
                <charAction>He places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures
                toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed
                voice.</charAction> Please, sit. Why don't you enjoy a cup of calming Jasmine

   <section>
      <description>Zuko points in the direction of where the light once was. Iroh calmly
                continues with his game, placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the
                previous one. As he does, a gust of wind washes over him, shaking his
                tiles.</description>
      <description>Cut to the iceberg, where the gale has begun to settle. Sokka had
                protectively clutched Katara, but he now releases her as he looks around. Light
                still encircles the remains of the former mountain of ice, now reduced to a
                hollowed-out crater. Sokka looks at his sister and they both get to their feet,
                Katara holding onto her brother. He points his spear at the crater, ready to defend
                them, though lowers it in shock as a figure emerges slowly from the depression in
                the iceberg.</description>

      <description>Now standing atop the crater, the figure slowly erects himself and looks
                down at them, and the two siblings stare back in wonder and fear.</description>
      <description>The circles of light finally dissipate as the boy stops glowing. The figure
                is revealed to be nothing more than a young boy, who gives a moan of exhaustion and
                suddenly faints. Katara gasps and runs forward to catch him before he hits the
                ground. Sokka follows behind and begins to poke at the boy's head with the blunt end
                of his spear.</description>

      <description>Katara places the boy gently against the base of the crater. Close-up of
                the boy as he slowly opens his gray eyes. He gasps in awe as he beholds the Southern
                Water Tribe girl, who stares at him, in wonder, with deep blue eyes. Her hair
                loopies sway in the wind.</description>

                other two. Katara looks at him in awe while Sokka backs away in shock, aiming his

      <description>A low, gruff noise suddenly fills the air, coming from within the crater of
                the iceberg. Quickly, the boy scrambles up the ridge of ice and happily jumps on the
                head of a large, furry creature that has the same arrow-shaped marking on his
                forehead as the boy.</description>

      <description>He opens an eyelid that immediately closes again once it is released. He
                jumps down to the front of the bison and tries to lift its enormous head. Sokka and
                Katara appear around the corner as Appa finally starts to react to Aang, opening his
                mouth and licking Aang with his giant tongue. Sokka's jaw drops upon seeing the

      <description>Aang looks questioningly at Sokka for a moment, but his attention is

                about to happen, Aang ducks before Appa sneezes, sending a large blast of green snot
                flying directly onto Sokka, who becomes completely covered in it. He squeals in
                disgust and begins to frantically try clean it off, rubbing his face in the snow

      <description>The camera switches to a shot where both siblings are sitting on Appa's

      <description>Aang whips the reins and Appa growls in response. He moves his tail up and
                down and takes a huge jump into the air. He soars through the air for merely a few
                seconds, making it appear as though he would fly, before belly-flopping into the
                water with a splash. The bison begins trudging through the water slowly. Katara
                crawls to the front of the saddle while Aang tries to get Appa flying, whipping the
                reins again.</description>

      <description>The picture tilts up and fades away to reveal Zuko standing on the helm of

   <section>
      <description>Aang uncomfortably turns around and a look of guilt crosses his face. The
                camera switches to another wide shot of Appa swimming through the vast sea,
                reflecting the brilliant sunlight.</description>
      <description>The scene switches to a dream of Aang's, colored in various shades of gray.
                Aang is sleeping on Appa's saddle while clouds build around and ahead of him.
                Lightning splits the sky and the rumble of the following thunder awakens him. He
                shoots up and looks around. In the next shot it is raining and Aang is sitting on
                Appa's head again, holding the reigns and screaming at the top of his lungs in
                terror while they go down. Appa and Aang splash into the waters of the ocean. Appa
                resurfaces again, growls, but is quickly subdued anew by another wave. Both Aang and
                Appa sink unconscious into the water. As Aang releases the reigns and drifts off,
                his eyes and tattoos suddenly start to glow brightly. He slams his fists together,
                creating a bluish-white sphere that encases Appa and himself. As the air sphere
                slowly solidifies into an icy globe, a voice permeates the dream.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang? Aang! Wake up. <charAction>Aang shoots up, throwing the covers of his body and
                gasping for air. Katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that Aang is
                awake.</charAction> It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready.
                <charAction>She points to the door of the tent.</charAction> Everyone's waiting to
            meet you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang happily gets out of bed and starts to dress himself while Katara takes
                a step toward the door. Before she exits, however, she glances back at Aang and
                gasps, staring in wonder at the blue, arrow-shaped tattoos that trace his arms and
                legs and reach up his back and to his head. Before Aang is able to get up, Katara
                pulls him along by his arm to meet the rest of the village.</description>
      <description>Aang is dragged out the tent toward a small congregation of villagers. He
                passes Sokka, who is sitting at the side of the tent, sharpening his
                boomerang.</description>

      <description>Aang bows respectfully toward the villagers, but they cower away in fear,

      <description>Aang grabs hold of his glider and pushes himself off the ground, leaving

      <description>Aang's shadow passes over Katara, who is smiling broadly at him. Aang,
                intending to further impress the villagers, flies sideways and closes his eyes while
                grinning broadly. He promptly flies head-on into the village's watchtower, causing
                his head to be stuck in its side. Katara covers her mouth as she watches Aang
                struggle to extricate his head from the icy watchtower. Succeeding, he tumbles
                downward onto a pile of snow at the base of the tower that crumbled from the
                building. Katara immediately rushes to his side while Sokka stares in shock at the
                damage inflicted on his watchtower.</description>

      <description>The scene shifts to Zuko's ship where Zuko is facing two soldiers dressed

                his left. The firebender to his right jumps forward to aim a blast at Zuko's feet.
                The prince propels himself out of the way. He twists around in mid-air and directs
                another fire blast with his hand to the firebender that retaliated first, and
                another with his foot to the firebender that aimed for his feet. Both soldiers jump
                out of the way of Zuko's flames. Zuko lands and stretches his fists out toward his

                over the ceiling past Katara. The tunnel levels out on an open plain of ice where
                the two get off their rides. The plain itself is dominated by a large metal ship,

                <charAction>Aang picks up a Guan Dao to inspect it.</charAction> I've never seen any
            war.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, how long were you in that iceberg?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Uncertain.</charAction> I don't know. A few days, maybe?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I think it was more like a hundred years!&gt;

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>In full disbelief and slightly accusing.</charAction> What?! That's
            impossible! Do I look like a hundred-twelve-year-old man to you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow,
            you were in there the whole time! <charAction>Aang's expression changes to one of
                comprehension.</charAction> It's the only explanation.</speech>

      <description>Aang backs away and slumps to floor in shock.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">A hundred years! <charAction>Saddened by his new discovery.</charAction> I can't

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Squats beside him.</charAction> I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a
            bright side to all this ...</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Smiling warmly at him while offering her hand.</charAction> Come on,
            let's get out of here.</speech>

      <description>Katara smiles and pulls him to his feet and the two exit the
                room.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy.</speech>

      <description>Aang ventures down yet another room with Katara on his trail. There, he
                trips over a thin rope; as he stumbles, metal bars slide downward over the entrance,
                barring it and trapping them inside.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Huh?</speech>

      <description>They both run toward the bars and peek through them.</description>

      <description>The gears and engines of the shipwreck suddenly power up, beginning to
                function. In shock, Katara and Aang follow the movements of the machines until
                suddenly, a flare is fired and explodes high in the sky.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Uh oh ... <charAction>Aang notices a hole in the roof of the ship and takes a
                surprised Katara into his arms.</charAction> Hold on tight!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Aaah!</speech>

      <description>Aang enhances the power of his jump with his airbending to jump several
                feet into the air through the hole.</description>
      <description>The scene switches to Prince Zuko, who is peering through a telescope. He
                follows every movement the duo makes as Aang, still holding Katara, jumps down the
                side of the ship.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">The last airbender! <charAction>Aang and Katara reach the ground again and Aang sets
                Katara down. They start to walk away.</charAction> Quite agile for his old age.
                <charAction>He turns and angrily yells to a soldier behind him.</charAction> Wake my
            uncle! Tell him I found the Avatar. <charAction>Zuko peeks through his telescope again
                to see that Katara and Aang are running now. Zuko follows the direction they are
                running in with his telescope and discovers that they must be headed for the village
                he spots.</charAction> As well as his hiding place ...</speech>
