      <description>The episode opens to a forested area at sunset. The camera pans downward to
                show Team Avatar, now including Toph, preparing to set up the campsite. Aang hands
                Sokka a sleeping bag. Toph stands on the ground near Appa.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">Hey! You guys picked a great campsite. <charAction>This directs everyone's attention
                to her. She wriggles her toes in the thick mat of fur covering the ground around the
                bison.</charAction> The grass is so soft.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">That's not grass. <charAction>Somewhat displeased.</charAction>Â  Appa's

      <description>Cuts to Aang sitting on Appa, a bluebird perched on his head and a yellow
                butterfly fluttering past. Momo jumps up in an attempt to catch the
                butterfly.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cheerfully.</charAction> That's not gross, it's just a part of spring!
            You know, rebirth, flowers blooming and Appa gets a new coat.</speech>

      <description>Appa, who had currently been grooming himself, sneezes, releasing a thick
                cloud of fur.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Waving arms about, now coated in fur.</charAction> Stop! Appa, stop!
            Ugh! <charAction>Coughs.</charAction>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Bending over, his back turned to her.</charAction> It's not that bad,
            Katara. <charAction>He turns to reveal a wig made of fur, done up in a towering
                beehive.</charAction> It makes a great wig!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Wearing a beard of fur.</charAction> And a great beard! <charAction>Aang
                and Sokka laugh while pointing at each other.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Wiping fur off her clothing with her eyes closed.</charAction> I'm just

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Walking up from behind the two boys.</charAction> Excuse me, does anyone
            have a razor? Because I've got some hairy pits!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She raises her arms, revealing that she had stuffed fur in her sleeves. The
                three laugh; Aang sneezes, sending himself flying backward. The big sneeze causes
                him to crash against Appa's leg and for fur to blow off his friends and himself. The
                impact leaves some fur on his back. They continue to laugh joyfully, causing Katara
                to chuckle slightly. The scene cuts to later in the evening where the group is
                setting up camp. Aang sets up the tent while Sokka throws down a pile of firewood he
                collected. Katara, who spends her time stirring around water in a pot, notices Toph
                slumped lazily against a rock, chewing a piece of wheat. She approaches
                her.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, <charAction>Holds arms out in
                gesture.</charAction> some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up
            the fire pit, or put up the tent. <charAction>Momo flies over to her, dropping several
                berries he had collected into her hands.</charAction> Even Momo does his fair
            share.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Breezily.</charAction> Katara, I'm fine. I can carry my own weight. I

   <section>
      <description>Toph earthbends herself into her tent. Later that day, set up continues.
                Standing on top of Appa, Aang uses airbending to lift the saddle. He mistakenly
                causes it to land directly on top of Sokka, who had been standing on the ground
                beside the bison.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cuts to Katara, who sets down a jug of water. She looks over at Toph,
                sitting comfortably beneath her earth tent. Her dull expression changes to one of
                slight happiness. She approaches Toph who is eating some sort of food
                item.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Rubs back of head sheepishly.</charAction> Hey Toph, I wanted to
            apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's

   <section>
      <description>Katara turns around and leaves. The scene changes to nightfall hours later
                where everyone is asleep. Toph is suddenly startled awake. She rises and presses her
                left hand to the ground to feel the vibrations within the earth. Close-up on her
                left hand and ear, indicating she hears something. She rises to her feet and runs
                out of the tent.</description>

      <description>Cuts to shot of the forest, a cloud of smoke billowing toward them in a
                clearing in the distance. Appa appears on screen, the team riding atop him. Aang
                leans against the saddle to peer at the object.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cuts to a shot of a tank train mechanism racing speedily along the ground.
                Cuts to shot of the night sky, the moon partly obscured by clouds. Cuts to Aang who
                yawns sleepily, dark circles beginning to form under his eyes. Cuts to Sokka who
                appears ready to fall asleep as he leans his head on his hand. Cuts to Toph and
                Katara sitting on Appa's saddle idly. Cuts to Appa who flies over mountainous
                terrain and lands on a smooth, rocky surface.</description>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Leaping off Appa and lying on the ground, relieved.</charAction> Ah,

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang hands Sokka his sleeping bag which he proceeds to smell. Sokka turns
                away, his disgusted face growing red, and falls backward, passing out.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> That's not the point. <charAction>Approaches

            earthbending. So don't you talk to me about being selfish!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>While she is saying this, a fuming Katara is seen tensing her muscles in
                frustration and raising her hand in an attempt to speak. After finished speaking,
                Toph sits down on the ground and earthbends an earth tent over her.</description>

      <description>Toph uses earthbending to release a fissure that channels underground and

                look on her face. The three begin racing toward the group.</description>

      <description>Toph earthbends a huge rock wall in front of the trio. Cuts to Azula who

                Toph is clearly shocked at this. Cuts to Mai who swings her arm, releasing a flurry
                of stilettos. Toph launches herself off a pillar. The darts strike the pillar and

                galloping by. Zuko is seen riding on his ostrich horse, a look of determination on

                soaring just above the treetops. Toph, Sokka, Katara and Momo sway to the side still
                tightly gripping the saddle. Appa soars through the trees, colliding into and
                snapping several branches. Cuts to shot of the team members who brace against the
                impact. The camera zooms out to depict a flock of birds resting in the trees,
                fleeing from the incident, before panning downward to show Appa on the ground,
                having created a channel way behind him from the impact. Cuts to shot of Appa

                him on either side. Cuts to shot of the river's surface where clumps of fur collect
                in the water. Cuts to a shot of the top of Appa's head where Momo lands, holding a
                brush. He scrubs the bison's head and is forced to hastily take flight when a stream
                of water is bent his way. Cuts to shot of Appa's head, Sokka standing in the river
                several feet away, holding a brush. He groans as he becomes drenched by the stream
                of water. The scene changes to the campsite where Appa stands on the ground, his fur
                still wet from the bath. Sokka can be seen standing by the riverbank, wringing out

                Katara riding atop him. As he flies away, his body accidentally brushes against the
                treetops, snapping the topmost limbs off and causing them to fall to the ground.
                Aang watches as the bison flies away and turns. Taking a running start, he flies
                away from the scene on his glider, releasing patches of fur from the bag along the
                way, creating a misleading trail.</description>
      <description>Cuts to shot of a mountain range, fog partially obscuring their peaks. The

                level shot of her foot which shifts abruptly in the opposite direction. Cuts to shot
                of her as she turns her head swiftly. She uses earthbending to send a stream of
                earth toward the unknown source. The stream of earth travels its way to a large rock
                ahead and a dust cloud erupts in the air from the impact. A grunt of pain is heard
                from behind the rock. Cuts to shot of Toph who approaches the rock still assuming a
                fighting stance. Cuts to shot of Iroh, his back to the camera as he kneels over and
                rubs his rear in pain. Cuts to shot of his face as he grimaces from the

                She pulls on the reigns and heads in the opposite direction, following the fake

      <description>The scene changes to another area of the forest, a cluster of trees growing
                on a rocky ledge overlooking the rest of the forest, the river channeling right
                through the landscape. Mountains are seen in the distance. Aang comes into view,
                flying on his glider, releasing the fur from his satchel. He exits the lush, green
                landscape area and soars over a more arid, rugged terrain. Camera briefly focuses on
                him, his eyes tired from lack of sleep as he peers down and looks
                forward.</description>
      <description>The camera pans upward to depict an old abandoned town, Tu Zin, similar to
                historical Western towns. Aang heads toward the town, still dropping fur. Cuts to
                side-view of the front of the town as he lands on the ground. Cuts to show the rest
                of the town. Aang's legs come into view and he twirls his glider staff closed. Cuts
                to overhead shot of him walking through the middle street way of the town, casually
                dropping fur. Cuts to shot of old store, the shutters creaking and a bell tolling in
                the wind. Cuts to side-view of Aang as he continues walking forward. Cuts to
                close-up of him as he averts his eyes sleepily from side-to-side. Cuts to shot of
                building and a side-view of him walking shown from in between two
                buildings.</description>
      <description>Cuts to shot of the ground, the camera panning upward to show the satchel
                being held upside-down, the remaining fur dropping onto the ground. Cuts to overhead
                shot of him as he opens his glider. He turns to face the horizon. Cuts to shot of
                him looking into the distance, his back to the screen. He looks down. Cuts to shot
                of him standing at the end of the town as he twirls his glider closed. He sits down
                on the ground cross-legged. The camera zooms out on the town. The scene changes to
                where Appa lazily soars overhead in the forest. Cuts to shot of Sokka and Katara
                mounted on him.</description>

      <description>Cuts to riverbank where the siblings embrace. Katara opens her eyes and
                gasps. Sokka turns around and becomes horrified. Cuts to side-view of the mongoose
                lizards paddling the water rapidly, allowing for them to walk over the surface of
                the river. Katara steps forward and spins around, sending a wave of water crashing
                into Ty Lee's mongoose lizard. Ty Lee leaps off the beast just in time and emerges
                from the water. She lands near the treetops where she gracefully dodges from tree
                trunk to tree trunk in pursuit of Katara, who opens her water skin.</description>
      <description>Ty Lee somersaults onto the ground. Katara attempts to lash a water whip in
                her direction, however, is forced to quickly dodge several of the acrobat's blows.
                She narrowly avoids having her chi blocked and fires several sharp discs of water at
                her enemy, who cartwheels repeatedly to escape. Cuts to shot of Mai still mounted on
                her lizard. She turns around and fires several stilettos from uploaded holsters in
                her sleeves. Cuts to quick shot of the stilettos before one of Katara still fending
                off Ty Lee, her back to the camera. Sokka steps on-screen and knocks the stilettos
                off-target with his machete and boomerang.</description>
      <description>He throws his boomerang in Mai's direction, however, the knife thrower
                merely leaps off her lizard, avoiding the attack. She spins around and fires
                stilettos from a holster in her leg. Sokka knocks them away again with his machete.
                Cuts to shot of Mai, who runs forward. Cuts to view of Katara, Sokka seen in the
                background. Katara turns around and is forced on the run when Mai comes charging
                toward her. Cuts to shot of Ty Lee, who runs toward the camera. She somersaults and
                leaps into the air where she flips and lands on the ground near Sokka.</description>
      <description>She lands several quick blows on Sokka, using chi blocking to incapacitate
                Sokka's right arm. Sokka drops his boomerang as a result of this. He swings his left
                arm toward Ty Lee who merely incapacitates that arm, resulting in him dropping his
                machete. Sokka looks about him nervously and resorts to kicking his leg in order to
                fend off the acrobat who proceeds to render his leg useless. Sokka proceeds to use
                his forehead as a shield. Ty Lee strikes his skull and injures her hand in the
                process. She backs away and shakes her fist in pain before turning to glare at
                Sokka.</description>

                and halts in front of the tree. She begins to draw a stream of water with which to
                attack Mai, however, the knife thrower hurls two shuriken knives her way. Each of
                the two knives pins her wrists to the tree trunk. Katara gasps in horror. Cuts to
                side-view of the riverbank as the stream of water falls into the river again and
                Sokka hobbles on-screen as a result of the paralysis. He falls to the

      <description>The two are suddenly swept off their feet by a powerful gust of wind

                who averts his gaze first to Azula before looking toward Aang. Cuts to Aang who
                assumes a fighting stance, pointing his glider at Zuko in fright. Cuts to shot of
                the three from the perspective of the front porch of a store, the camera panning to
                the left from Aang to Azula. Cuts to shot of Zuko, who shifts the position of his
                fingers a bit. Cuts to Aang, who looks about him nervously. Cuts to Azula, who
                continues to smirk in confidence. Cuts to close-up of Zuko, a shot of Aang, before
                switching back to Zuko. Cuts to close-up of Azula, whose smile widens. Cuts to brief
                shot of Zuko.</description>
      <description>Cuts to Azula, who moves her arm forward, firing a blast of blue fire at
                Zuko, who conjures up a fire shield to deflect it. He falls backward onto a front
                porch. Aang, upon seeing this, expresses horror and attempts to flee the town on his
                glider. He begins soaring toward the back end of Tu Zin. Cuts to Azula, who swings
                her arm downward, sending a stream of fire at Aang, who turns over mid-air and
                closes his glider, twirling the object to deflect the flames. Cuts to side-view of
                the town as he lands on the ground, still deflecting the flames. He stops twirling
                his glider.</description>
      <description>Cuts to shot of Azula running along the beam of a rooftop, prepared to
                strike him. Cuts to ground level shot of Aang who rolls over, grabbing hold of his
                glider just as Azula lands nimbly on the ground, sweeping around, sending a stream
                of fire his way. Cuts to shot of the street where Azula rises and turns around, Zuko
                seen standing in the background. Aang leaps on-screen and lands on the ground, in
                between the other two. Zuko fires a blast at Aang who steps to the side, managing to
                avoid the attack. Azula fires at the Avatar and misses.</description>
      <description>After the three perform several unsuccessful attempts to land a blow, Aang
                runs past Azula, who sends another sweep of fire his way. Cut to slanted shot of
                three, Aang trying to escape toward the back end of town, Azula turning to face him
                and Zuko firing blasts of his own. Aang rounds a bend and runs past Azula once more,
                this time heading toward the front of town. Azula fires another blast at him, only
                to miss. Azula fires several more blows, one of which Zuko manages to deflect. He
                fires a shot at Azula and misses.</description>
      <description>Cuts to shot of Azula, who swings her arms about, sending attacks at her
                opponents. Cuts to overhead shot of the town, the three of them continuing to battle
                each other. Cuts to shot of Azula, Zuko appearing on-screen, leaping into the air
                directly behind her and striking the ground, unleashing a firebending attack in the
                process. Cuts to side-view of the two siblings as two walls of fire, one blue and
                one orange are created as a result of the impact. Azula fires a blast at Zuko, who
                ducks and attempts to knock her off her feet. He fires a blast her only for the
                princess to duck. She sweeps her arm upward, sending a stream of fire his way. Zuko
                leaps into the air to avoid the attack. Azula turns around and fires at Aang. Cuts
                to shot of the Avatar, who leaps into the air and lands onto an upper outdoors level
                of a nearby building.</description>
      <description>Azula runs up the stairwell leading to the upper level, forcing Aang to run
                through the open doorway. Cuts to shot of the inside of the doorway; Azula appears
                on-screen and her expression suddenly grows alarmed. She halts in her tracks and
                nearly stumbles. Cuts to view of the entire inside of the building, revealing that
                there is no floor, merely some jagged wooden paneling lining the edges of the wall.
                She windmills in an attempt to steady herself. Cuts to Aang perched atop an air
                ball, smiling gleefully and waving to her. After leaping about a few times, Azula
                manages to prop herself against the wall and regains her balance. Zuko suddenly
                appears in the doorway. He has the misfortune of inaccurate timing and falls roughly
                onto the first level floor with a yell, sending up a cloud of dust. Aang grimaces in
                sympathy.</description>
      <description>The air ball Aang is riding suddenly begins to dissipates. Cuts to Azula,
                who nimbly sends a blast of fire at him. Cuts back to Aang, who leaps out of the way
                just as the air ball is terminated. He runs along the edges along the thin floor
                paneling and knocks Azula onto the first floor in the process. Azula lands nimbly
                onto the ground near Zuko, who is still recovering from his fall. Cuts to the
                outside of the building as Aang exits through the doorway, narrowly avoiding a blue
                fire blast sent by Azula off-screen.</description>
      <description>He lands onto the ground just as Azula bursts through the wall of the
                building through the use of firebending. Zuko lands on the ground unconscious. Cuts
                to shot of Aang, who looks at Zuko before turning around and seeing Azula heading
                straight toward him. He flees and leaps out of the way just as Azula sends another
                blast at him. Aang begins alternately jumping between two buildings, with Azula
                firing blasts off-screen at each spot he lands on. Aang finally reaches the rooftop
                of the left building and scrambles to prop himself up.</description>
      <description>Azula sends a blast of fire, slicing a portion of the rooftop off. Aang
                leaps off the crumbling portion onto another spot on the roof, only for Azula to
                repeat the same action. Cuts to shot Aang, who scrambles to prop himself up only for
                the ceiling to cave in. He lands on the ground inside the building, trapped beneath
                a pile of wooden planks. Azula enters the building through the doorway and sends two
                streams of fire along the sides of the wall. The blue fire spreads around the
                perimeter of the room and turns an orange hue. Cuts to Aang, who looks horrified and
                attempts to break free.</description>
      <description>Cuts to Azula, who smirks and holds up one hand, two fingers pointing
                outward, her typical lightning generation pose. Katara suddenly appears in the
                doorway and sends a water whip at Azula, guiding her hand off course. Katara bends
                the stream of water around her and slices the wooden planks, thus freeing
                Aang.</description>

      <description>Azula swiftly turns around and fires a blast at the waterbender, who races
                out of the building along the porch. Azula follows her in hot pursuit, only to be
                halted by Sokka, who emerges from another doorway and swings his machete her way.
                Katara runs off-camera, while Azula is forced to duck. Sokka begins chasing her.
                Cuts to overhead shot of the town where Azula is now being cornered by him, Katara
                and Aang. Cuts to shot of Zuko still lying on the ground as he regains
                consciousness. Cuts to shot of Iroh standing over him from his perspective, the shot
                slightly blurred to show the effect of being knocked out.</description>

      <description>He helps Zuko get up. Cuts to shot of Aang as he runs straight toward
                Azula, his back facing the camera. He leaps over her just as Azula fires a blast at
                him which heads directly toward the camera. She turns around and blocks a water whip
                Katara sends at her. She fires a blast at Sokka and swings her arm outward to
                prolong the blast. Aang appears on-screen behind her. She turns around and nearly
                manages to strike him with another blast. Cuts to overhead shot of the three Team
                Avatar members and Azula, who swings her arm outward, sending an arched fire blast
                at the three. Cuts to shot of Azula who stands, poised for attack. Camera pans
                downward to her feet. She suddenly falls over to the side; Toph appears from an
                alleyway, having just shifted the ground beneath her feet.</description>

      <description>Azula rises to her feet and begins running away. Cuts to shot from the view
                of an alleyway, where Azula appears on-screen and runs through the alley. She leaps
                over some crates and tries to escape, however, Iroh intervenes, using his rotund
                belly to knock her off her feet. Zuko appears on-screen next to him. Cuts to
                overhead shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, Toph, Zuko and Iroh all cornering Azula
                against the ruins of a stone wall.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cuts to shot of Iroh, who averts his gaze toward the other members, who
                remain on high alert. The camera switches to his point of view, zooming in on Toph
                and shifting upward to Aang, Katara and Sokka, who still assume fighting stances.
                Cuts briefly to Azula, who smirks, before switching to Toph from Iroh's point of
                view. Cuts to Azula, who smiles and takes a step forward, firing a blast at Iroh,
                who gets hit. He screams in pain and falls to the ground.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The remaining five turn to face Azula, four of them bending their
                respective elements and Sokka throwing his boomerang straight for her. The impact of
                the elements creates a minor explosion, sending a thick cloud of smoke everywhere.
                Cuts to buildings in the town now set alight, burning embers falling from the sky.
                Cuts to shot of Aang as the smoke clears, who looks from his defensive position at
                the effect. Cuts overhead shot of the group surrounding the corner, the smoke
                clearing to reveal Azula having vanished from the scene without a trace. Cuts to
                Zuko, who kneels before his uncle, dismayed at the turn of events.</description>

      <description>Cuts to Toph, the camera shifting to her foot, showing that she can detect
                the vibrations using seismic sense. Cuts to Iroh, who is still breathing, indicating
                that he is still alive. Katara approaches Zuko.</description>

      <description>The members of Team Avatar all run away off-screen, leaving Zuko still
                kneeling over Iroh. The camera pans upward to show thick smoke billowing from the
                fire. The scene fades to a mountain at nightfall where Appa lands. Cuts to shot of
                Team Avatar sleeping on the saddle. Camera zooms in on Toph and Katara resting next
                to each other.</description>
