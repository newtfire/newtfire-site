      <description>Cut to Zuko and Iroh riding on their ostrich horse. Iroh fake-moans in
                pretend pain at every step the ostrich horse takes, clasping his left
                arm.</description>

      <speech speaker="Iroh">No please, don't stop just for me!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Switch to a front view of Zuko and Iroh. Iroh theatrically lets out several
                more groans of pain. Zuko pull at the reins, annoyed by the performance displayed by
                his uncle. As they dismount, the ostrich horse is alarmed by something. Zuko
                immediately takes on a firebending form, ready to defend himself.</description>

      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Annoyed.</charAction> What now?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The Rough Rhinos ride through the thicket at both sides of the road Zuko
                and Iroh were traveling on. Mongke's rhino steps the ground forcefully breaking the
                surface. Mongke is shown, pulling back the reigns. Zuko keeps up his defensive
                position, looking at the men that surrounded them. Iroh's face clears up as he
                stands up and places a hand on Zuko's shoulder.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Surprised.</charAction> You know these guys?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Sure. Colonel Mongke and the Rough Rhinos are legendary. Each one is a different
            kind of weapon specialist. <charAction>The camera cuts to each member of the Rough
                Rhinos.</charAction> They are also a very capable singing group.</speech>

      <description>Cut to Mongke, who has his fist raised, ready for

         <charAction>While rubbing his arm.</charAction> Would you like some tea first? I'd

      <speech speaker="Mongke">Enough stalling! Round 'em up!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Camera shows an overhead view of the situation. Cut to Ogodei swinging his
                ball and chain at Iroh, who kicks it away. The chain wraps itself around the leg of
                Kahchi's rhino. Iroh tumbles over the ground, dodging two fire blasts. He rises back
                up and hits the rhino in the rear, making it dash away, yanking Ogodei off his rhino
                and dragging him along. Iroh waves goodbye as he watches them go.</description>
      <description>Vachir shoots a lit arrow at Zuko. He quickly reacts by knocking the arrow
                away and releasing a fire blast, burning a hole in the surprised archer's
                bow.</description>
      <description>Mongke joins the fight by directing some fire blasts at Iroh. Iroh deflects
                each and every one of them. As Mongke is busy with Iroh, Zuko runs up and jumps on
                the back of the Rhino. With two spinning fire kicks, he sends Colonel Mongke
                flying.</description>
      <description>Iroh runs up to the ostrich horse, jumps on and rides toward Zuko, who
                awaits him, standing on the Rhino of Colonel Mongke. As he jumps on, Yeh-Lu
                immediately starts the pursuit. He throws a grenade at the fleeing ostrich horse. It
                explodes right in front of it, but Iroh and Zuko ride through the explosion's
                smoke.</description>

         <charAction>Grasping his shoulder again as he racks his brain in search of an
                answer.</charAction> Hmmm ... Old friends that don't want to attack me ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Katara, Sokka and Toph, all exhausted and dehydrated, still
                wandering through the desert. Sokka stops to take Momo off his back and use his
                wings to create some shade, causing Toph to crash into him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Annoyed.</charAction> Can't you watch where you're ... <charAction>His

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka's clothes stick to Toph. He tries to free himself by pushing her
                away.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>An irritated Toph places her hand on Sokka's face and pushes him to the
                ground, freeing them both.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Katara, can I have some more water?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara bends three small blobs of water out of her pouch and into the
                mouths of Sokka, Toph and Momo. Sokka circulates the water in his mouth before
                swallowing it.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>As he points to his mouth.</charAction> We're drinking your bending
            water. <charAction>He tries to define the taste of the water, smacking his lips.
                Disgustedly he exclaims.</charAction> You used this on the swamp guy! Urch!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">It does taste swampy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Momo lets out a sad cry in protest of the water's flavor, after also
                smacking his lips. Katara sadly puts the cork back on her water sack.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Sad tone.</charAction> I'm sorry, it's all we have.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Not anymore! Look!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara looks in the direction Sokka's pointing. He walks over to the cactus
                and cuts off a piece with his machete. He happily drinks the fluid that's inside
                while Momo crawls over to him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Worried.</charAction> Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange
            plants!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She drags Toph along on her arm as she runs toward Sokka. He and Momo are
                quenching their thirst with plenty of cactus juice. He cuts open another part of the
                cactus, excitedly offering its content to a skeptic looking Katara.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">There's water trapped inside these!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>While cactus juice drips off his chin.</charAction> Suit yourself. It's
            very thirst quenching though.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He gives Katara a big smile like a true salesman. Cut to close-up of his
                left eye as his pupil dilates rapidly. He tries to shake off the feeling by rapidly
                shaking his head. He starts to trip.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>In a strange echoing voice.</charAction> Drink cactus juice. It'll
            quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. <charAction>He crawls over the ground as a caterpillar
                before jumping back to the front, pushing his face toward the camera with a big
                smile.</charAction> It's the quenchiest!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara gives Sokka a very weird look. She grabs his cactus juice and pours
                it away.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Okay, I think you've had enough.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Who lit Toph on fire?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara wants to react on Sokka's comment, but is distracted by a sound in
                the sky. She looks up to see Momo flying around in circles, increasing his speed,
                before plummeting into the ground, head first. Katara picks up and cradles the
                unconscious animal.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Can I get some of that cactus?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Wrapping her arm around Toph's shoulders.</charAction> I don't think
            that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara leads Toph away. Sokka stays behind, staring blankly at the sky.
                Katara retraces her steps and pulls Sokka along by his arms. Cut to an overview shot
                of the endless desert.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>In awe.</charAction> How did we get out here in the middle of the
            ocean?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara sighs as the scene cuts to Aang flying over the desert in search of
                Appa. He blows his bison whistle.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Appa! <charAction>He glides down and lands on a dune.</charAction> Appa!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The camera circles around Aang. While he stares across the horizon, it
                begins to dawn on him that he is not going to find his friend out here. The tears
                well up in his eyes.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">No ... <charAction>Yelling.</charAction> No!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Overcome by anger, he slams his staff on the ground, creating a large
                mushroom-shaped cloud of sand. Dust that was kicked up by Aang's blow washes over
                Katara, Sokka and Toph as they climb over another dune.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">What is that?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As Katara leads Toph away, Sokka starts to worship the mushroom by waving
                his arms up and down, back and forth.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka. It is nearly twilight and they are still
                walking in a single file through the desert. A shadow passes over their heads and
                Aang lands behind them, kicking up a small cloud of sand. As the sand clears, Aang
                is still down.</description>

      <description>Katara directs her gaze to the sky and sees four buzzard wasps circling
                above their heads. She looks at every other member in the team. Aang still sits down
                sulking and Toph staggers a bit. Sokka sniggers a bit while Momo lazily claws at the

                the other direction.</description>

      <description>Camera shows a close-up of a grinning Xin Fu. As he moves toward Zuko and
                Iroh, two men jump in front of him to block his path. With a reverse roundhouse
                kick, the earthbender bends a rock from the ground and easily pushes them out of his
                way.</description>
      <description>Yu readies himself for battle. He sinks the first person to charge him into

                flying. One of them crashes into the wall behind the bar.</description>
      <description>When there is no one left to fight, Xin Fu and Yu realize that their prey
                has escaped during the chaos. Xin Fu growls in frustration and slams his two fists
                on the ground, erecting a giant pillar of earth under a downed sandbender, shooting
                him out of the window and against a palm tree.</description>
      <description>Cut to a scorpion walking over a rock. The camera shows how Momo is patting
                the sand he used to cover up Sokka while he is sleeping. He jumps away as Katara

                stand there, staring blankly to the sky. Toph sits up and rubs her right

                excited about. Katara begins to rub of the sand of the object that appears to be
                made of wood. Aang steps forward, suggestively holding up his staff. As soon as
                Katara backs away, Aang swings his staff around, creating a mighty gust of wind,
                revealing a boat of some sort. Katara crawls aboard and examines it.</description>

      <description>Cut to a shot of the giant rock from a distance, followed by a shot of the
                hive as more buzzard wasps swarm out and surround the group. Aang blasts the first
                wasp to come near them away with a strong air current.</description>
      <description>A second wasp lands on a nearby rock. The moment it touches it, Toph turns
                around to send the wasp flying again, shooting up the rock from underneath
                it.</description>
      <description>Another buzzard wasp flies between Sokka and Toph. She hears it fly behind
                her so she lifts the rock beside her and throws it in the general direction of the
                sound. The giant rock is only inches apart from crushing Sokka.</description>

      <description>A buzzard wasp swoops in from the sky and snatches up a screeching Momo as
                it flies away from the hive and the benders.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Momo! I'm not losing anyone else out here.</speech>

      <description>Full of anger, he takes off on his glider in hot pursuit of Momo and the
                wasp. Katara and Sokka watch him go.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Katara places Toph in the right direction. Toph kicks up some rocks and
                shoots them forward. The incoming buzzard wasp is shot down, taking several blows to
                the head. Sokka cheers, swinging his machete in the air.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara leads Toph on as they start to run along the ledge.</description>
      <description>Shift to a close-up of Aang. He is still chasing the buzzard wasp that took
                Momo. A grave expression casts shadows on his face. He dives, emerging again
                straight underneath the wasp. As he turns, he directs a strong gust of wind at the
                wasp with a kick of his leg. The gust forces the wasp to release Momo out of its
                clutches. Momo tumbles down, but quickly regains control and begins to soar next to
                Aang. Aang looks from Momo toward the rising sun at the horizon. With an angry
                glare, he notices that the wasp is getting away. Aang glides down, flying close to
                the ground. Using the speed of his descent, he closes his glider and swings his
                staff down. A powerful wall of air splits the sand, racing toward the escaping wasp.
                The animal is hit in mid air, knocking it to the ground. With a dark glare, Aang
                just stares at the downed wasp before walking back in the direction of the giant
                rock. Momo follows him quickly, frightened by this merciless outburst of
                power.</description>
      <description>Cut back to a shot of the giant rock, where buzzard wasps circle around
                Sokka and the rest, who've reached the sand-sailer at the base by now. Katara looks
                over Toph's shoulder, acting as her eyes.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">On your left!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph reacts immediately and shoots a rock at her left. The buzzard wasp
                takes the rock full in the chest, shrieking on impact before tumbling
                down.</description>
      <description>The camera pans out, showing many more wasps hovering in the air. Suddenly,
                gigantic pillars of sand rise from the ground and scare off the swarm. Katara, Sokka
                and Toph lower their arms they had lifted to shield their heads from the sand. As
                the wind blows the dust away, the camera pans to the left, revealing several
                sandbenders. Aang lands before Katara, Sokka and Toph, ready to face the
                sandbenders.</description>
      <description>Cut back to a shot of the flower shop in the desert village, where a
                sleeping Zuko is startled by the squeaking of the door. Iroh steps through as Zuko
                takes on a defensive stance.</description>

      <description>The wind around Avatar Aang starts the swirl, as his anger is reaching its
                peak. Sokka pull Toph along with him as he starts to make a break for it, running
                away from his enraged friend.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang drops his staff. The wind around him forms a fast moving sphere,
                knocking up sand high into the sky. As everyone runs away, Katara stays put, staring
                sadly at the ground. The sandstorm engulfs her and Aang completely, obscuring them
                from the sight of the others. They brace themselves as the whirlwind swoops over
                them.</description>
      <description>Aang's air sphere slowly lifts him up in the air, his teeth clenched and
                his hands cramped with rage. Katara grabs his right arm, preventing him from rising
                any further. The terrible face of an outraged Avatar looks down upon her, only to be
                met by Katara's sincere, sad expression. She pulls him back to the ground and
                presses him close against her chest. Sokka and Toph lower their arms as the wind
                becomes less violent. Tears are streaming down the Avatar's glowing eyes. Katara
                tries her best to hold on as her own tears well up. The air sphere slowly dissolves
                away as Aang leaves the Avatar state. His rage subsides to make room for pure,
                heartbreaking sadness.</description>
