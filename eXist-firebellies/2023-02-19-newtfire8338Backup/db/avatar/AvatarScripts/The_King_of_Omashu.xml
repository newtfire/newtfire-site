      <description>The episode opens with a close-up of a snow-covered patch of grass. The
                scene pans up to reveal Aang, with Katara, Sokka, Appa and Momo in his trail,
                reaching the top of a hill. Aang spreads his arms wide while the camera shifts to a
                back view of the group to reveal their view.</description>

      <description>Aang leaps off the top of the hill with his airbending. The camera position
                shifts to show that he had landed a few meters below and in the snow and is starting
                to slide down.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a shot of Aang wiggling his nose under which is now a patch of
                Appa's fur, serving as a mustache. The camera zooms back to show that Aang is also
                wearing a tall wig made of the same material.</description>

      <description>Appa slowly turns his head toward Aang and snorts at him as if he was
                scoffing. Cut to a shot of Sokka sitting on a rock with Katara standing beside him,
                arms crossed.</description>

      <description>Aang nimbly kicks up his staff and spins it rapidly around before placing
                it upright on the ground to be used as a walking stick. He hunches his back and
                leans heavily on his staff like an old person.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang shuffles out of the frame, while Sokka and Katara questioningly look
                at each other. The scene fades to shot of the chasm, panning upward to show Aang,
                Katara, and Sokka walking down the long path to Omashu. The shot changes to an
                overview of the path while the camera pans down, before shifting to an upward
                panning shot of the back of the trio to end with a center shot of the
                city.</description>

      <description>Aang's eyes widen in surprise as he hears the harsh voice of the sentry.

   <section>
      <description>Closer shot of the talking guard as he squishes the cabbage he is holding
                and knocks another two cabbages out of the merchant's hands. He proceeds by
                earthbending a rock under the cart, catapulting it high in the air, making it tumble
                down the chasm with all the cabbages.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The camera shifts to the left, where Katara, Sokka, and Aang appear and
                look over the rim, their mouths open in shock, as a loud crash is
                heard.</description>

   <section>
      <description>While Aang walks over to the guards, Katara and Sokka give each other an
                uneasy look. Katara flashes her teeth in an awkward way and chuckles uncomfortably,
                while Sokka merely raises a doubtful eyebrow. Side-view as Aang approaches the
                sentries at the gate. The earthbender steps to the front and raises a boulder out of
                the ground before Aang and levitates it above his head.</description>

      <description>Switch to side-view as Katara, Aang, and Sokka start walking toward the
                gate. Sokka passes the guard with an uneasy look on his face, never letting the
                guard out of sight.</description>

                <charAction>Close-up of Sokka as he halts, eyes widening in fear as the guard grasps
                his shoulder. Aang and Katara turn around to see what the holdup is. The guard turns
                Sokka around; sternly.</charAction> You're a strong young boy! Show some respect for
            the elderly and carry your grandfather's bag!</speech>

      <description>Aang throws the bag at Sokka; the bag bounces off his head to drop into his
                arms. Sokka shoots Aang an annoyed glare over his shoulder. Overview shot as the
                trio resumes walking to the gate once more. Back shot view of the trio standing
                before a big Earth Kingdom emblem on the wall before them. The giant earthen wall
                splits open in the middle of the emblem, opening up to let any passengers through.
                The guard opens up the gate walls. As the first wall slides open, a second and third
                are bent aside as well. Upward panning shot of Katara and Sokka watching in awe at
                the spectacle while Aang is smiling behind them. They walk through as the walls
                already start to move again to close right after them. A back view of Aang as he
                walks through the opened gates, when suddenly Momo's ears pop out of his wig.
                Close-up of the guard that granted them entrance, as his eyes widen in surprise. He
                tries to keep an eye on Aang as long as he can, but the airbender is obscured from
                his view by the closing gates.</description>
      <description>Switch to an overview shot from inside the city as the trio pulls up at the
                parapet at the rim of a nearby chasm. Closer shot of Sokka and Katara, excitedly
                taking in the city spread out before them as Aang pulls up next to them, Momo's head
                now entirely popped out of his wig. He leans on the rim as well and joins the
                siblings in mouth open gazing at Omashu's scenery. Cut to a shot of the streets
                filled with people. The camera pans up, revealing an intricate system of chutes. The
                aqueduct like structures are built over and beside the houses with typical green
                roofs.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Back to regular voice; voice-over.</charAction> This is the Omashu

            miles of tubes and chutes.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to four earthbenders standing beside a platform where one earthen cart
                slides out of the picture and another one filled with vegetables comes into view. As
                the cart passed one earthbender, he uses his bending to change the cart's directing
                and pushes it to the front, where another earthbender bends it up a tube to two
                other earthbenders standing at the ready to receive it. One earthbender quickly
                bends stone lintels underneath the cart so it would not fall down again, while the
                other one thrusts it off the platform, where it slides down a chute at high
                speed.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">

   <section>
      <description>Scene fades to a flashback to a hundred years ago, when Aang visited the
                city before. Back shot of a young Bumi watching over the city. When Aang walks up,
                he excitedly jumps around.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Bumi chuckles with an odd snort as the camera slowly moves to a close-up.
                Cut to a shot of Aang and Bumi riding down the "superslide", happily laughing. Bumi
                throws his hands in the air as they hurtle out of the scene.</description>
      <description>Slowly, the scene fades back to present day; the lush, green tree the duo
                passed, now old, snow-covered and without leaves. The camera moves up the slope,
                where the heads of Aang, with Momo in his wig, Katara and Sokka can be seen above
                the rim. Scene switches to a closer shot, revealing that they are sitting in a mail
                cart. Aang looks excited, while the siblings look around them, unsure and slightly
                frightened.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">

   <section>
      <description>Close-up of a happily laughing Aang. The camera moves up to reveal Momo in
                Aang's wig, holding on to the hair, squinting his eyes due to the wind. Camera
                shifts to the Water Tribe siblings, Katara screaming in fear, Sokka gritting his
                teeth in terror. Camera moves back as the cart makes a turn, and follows it down the
                slope. The chute they are riding pulls up next to a parallel one, where a cart with
                a rack of six spears is racing down. Switch to a side-view as the cart of the trio
                pulls up next to the cart with the spears and they all stare at it, no one making a
                sound. They race past it and both tracks join together. Sokka and Katara scream as
                the two chutes merge into one chute with the spear-cart behind them, but quickly
                gaining. Sokka hears it coming and turn around. He gasps and ducks just in time to
                avoid being skewered by the spears. Katara turns around, and screams in fear as she
                sees the weapons so close. Aang, smiling excitedly, turns as well to see what the
                commotion is all about.</description>

      <description>Switch to a frontal view of the cart, as Aang begins to rock it. Hitting
                each side once, the cart flies out of the chute and onto a roof, where it continues
                its descent.</description>
      <description>Cut to a shot of a soldier talking to his men.</description>

      <speech speaker="Soldier">Men, you'll be going off to combat soon. It's important that you be prepared for

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang, Katara, and Sokka come in riding the cart between the soldier and the
                warriors. The scene freezes for a second at that shot as the sound of a little bell
                can be heard, before continuing. The warriors gasp in surprise as the cart ricochets
                and continues moving. Switch to a scene of other carts moving over a chute. The cart
                with the trio breaks through the railing closing off the other chute and crosses the
                track, knocking over one of the supply carts, spilling a load of pumpkins all over
                the ground. The knocked over cart lies on the track, where another incoming cart
                crashes into it.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang airbends behind him. They pass by a restaurant, where a couple is
                eating together. They look up in surprise at the kids flashing by while the waiter
                dashes over to see what is going on. The scene switches to an earthbender soldier
                waiting for the arrival of the next cart. As a cart of scrolls stops in front of
                him, the camera tilts to the right, showing how the cart with the trio is flying
                down an incredibly steep slope. As the slope flattens out, the kids cry out in alarm
                as they are moments from colliding with the motionless cart in front of the bender.
                The earthbender on duty at that station sends it on its way, briefly relieving the
                trio in the speeding cart. Much to the riders' horror, another cart instantly pops
                up from the tube below the bender. Before it can be moved, the kids' cart crashes
                into it, catapulting them and their cart into the air, high above a lower level of
                the city. Aang airbends the cart in front of them as they fall, making them drop
                back into the cart. The kids ride down several roofs, leaving damaged tiles in their
                wake. The scene switches to inside a craftsman's home, where he whistles serenely as
                he puts the final touches on a vase. The cart flies through one window, ricochets
                off of the floor where the vase is, smashing it and making the riders grunt, and
                flying out the window opposite. The craftsman peers out the ruined window as a dust
                cloud emerges, revealing that the cart has crashed against something
                else.</description>

      <description>They land on a balcony and slide through another house. Emerging on the
                other side, a bearded cat chases Momo around Aang's wig until the lemur pushes it
                off. The cart smashes through a parapet and drops vertically out of sight. The view
                changes to the same cabbage merchant that had his cabbage cart thrown into the abyss
                earlier, now cuddling a cabbage at a replacement cart. Alerted by something coming
                from up above, he walks from underneath the cart's roof to check it out, and gasps
                in horror as the kids' cart drops on it, smashing the replacement cart to pieces and
                scattering what intact cabbages are left all over. Aang, Katara, and Sokka are in a
                tangled heap by the remains, while Momo elegantly floats down.</description>

      <description>The scene fades to the ceiling of the palace of Omashu. The camera pans
                down, revealing a watch guard in the front, and the King of Omashu sitting on his
                throne, flanked by two guards, in the back of an enormous room. The first watch
                guard slightly moves aside to let the three children pass. Sokka looks very uneasy,
                Katara slants her eyes up in an attempt to look sympathetic, and glances to the
                side. As she gazes at the king, the scene switches to a close-up of the elderly
                king, who looks at them questioningly, arching an eyebrow and grunting in wonder.
                The scene switches to a frontal view of the "visitors" as they are being pushed into

      <description>The camera slowly moves in on the king who squints his eyes and grunts

                of a whimpering Sokka, moves to one of a smiling Katara, her hands folded in front
                of her and her eyes twinkling hopefully. Aang is the only one who keeps staring at
                the side, one eyebrow arched and pouting. Switch to a close-up of the dissimilar

                richly-filled dining table. The camera pans to the right, revealing all sorts of
                different dishes and teapots. Camera zooms in on Momo as he eats a lot of the food,

      <description>Cut to a side shot of Aang as he suddenly dashes forward to the surprise of
                his two guards. Using his airbending, his speed is enhanced. Close-up of his feet as
                he quickly crosses the distance between him and King Bumi. Cut to a back shot of
                Bumi as Aang halts in front of him, the wind passing over them.</description>

      <speech speaker="Bumi">Oh, I thought you might refuse, <charAction>Side shot of the two. A wall opens,

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang looks back at Bumi. Cut to a frightened Katara as her guard slides a
                green ring over her finger. Close-up of the ring being put on. The moment the guard
                retracts his hand, the ring glows and tightens around her finger. The scene
                broadens, showing Sokka has gotten a ring as well, his being blue, and is now
                frantically trying to remove it from his finger. Katara tries to pull it off as
                well, both are unsuccessful.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">
         <charAction>Voice-over.</charAction> Those delightful rings are made of pure
            jennamite, also known as creeping crystal. It's a crystal that grows remarkably fast.
                <charAction>Close-up of Bumi; sinister.</charAction> By nightfall your friends will
            be completely covered in it. <charAction>Slightly sympathetic.</charAction> Terrible

   <section>
      <description>Bumi glances toward the siblings. Cut to a shot of Sokka's finger now
                donning a blue jennamite ring. The ring glows and expands toward his
                hand.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Close-up of an evil grinning Bumi. Scene changes to a cave filled with
                stalagmites and stalactites. Camera pans to the left where Aang stands on a flat
                rock with a waterfall in front of him. In the waterfall, there is a ladder, and
                above the ladder hangs a rope. Sokka, Katara, and Bumi are on a balcony cut into the
                wall to the left of the waterfall. King Bumi is laughing. Cut to a frontal shot of
                the king looking over the balcony rim. Katara and Sokka are guarded behind him. The
                jennamite ring has already expanded to engulf part of their right forearm. Bumi
                glances back at the siblings with a grin on his face. Close-up of the jennamite as
                it glows and creeps a bit further on the arms of Sokka and Katara. Switch to a back
                shot of Bumi as he is looking out toward where Aang is standing.</description>

      <speech speaker="Bumi">It seems I've lost my lunch box key and I'm hungry. Ooh, there it is!

            fetching it for me?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The key hanging from a chain and a vertical iron ladder are dimly visible
                behind the waterfall. Aang airbends to the base of the fall and plunges into the
                waterfall. He manages to climb up the rock face to the base of the ladder and grasp
                it with one hand. Before he can get any further, the torrent of water pushes him
                away and out.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Ooh, climbing the ladder. No one's thought
            of that before.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Panting, Aang rests a moment between two stalagmites, leaps from them to
                the stalactites above, and closer to the waterfall still high by the roof of the
                cavern. He dives into the fall above the key and tries to grab the key as he falls
                with the water; the rush of the water carries him past and in a moment he shoots out
                again, keyless.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">That's right. Keep diving head in. I'm sure it'll work eventually.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang cuts a stalagmite with airbending and throws it like a spear at the
                key, accelerating it with another air blast. The stone spear snags the chain
                suspending the key, and carries it out of the waterfall. The spear pierces the stone
                wall above the King's balcony, the key now dangling right in front of
                Bumi.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to Aang in a large sunken enclosure in a new room, with Bumi,
                Katara, and Sokka up above. Aang finds a lop-eared bunny.</description>

                and the bunny.</charAction> Huh?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Squealing with terror, the bunny bolts across the arena with Aang in
                pursuit until it goes into a hole. Aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder
                trying to grab hold of the frightened rabbit. The light dawns on his
                face.</description>

      <description>Aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder trying to grab hold of the

      <speech speaker="Katara">Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great!</speech>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The king gives an evil laugh and the scene dissolves to an earthbending
                arena. Aang and the king are on a balcony overlooking the arena, Sokka and Katara
                along with a guard are on an adjacent balcony. The crystals are past their heads,
                leaving their faces exposed.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The king straightens up and removes his outer robe, proving himself to be a
                powerfully built old man. He earthbends Aang off of the balcony, making him fly into
                the arena. The king jumps down right in front of Aang, and laughs.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">You thought I was a frail old man, but I'm the most powerful earthbender you'll ever

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The guard tosses Aang his staff. The king bends several rocks at Aang who
                just avoids and evades the attacks.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">Typical airbender tactic: avoid and evade. I hoped the Avatar would be less
            predictable.</speech>

      <description>The king attacks Aang some more. Aang just keeps avoiding and

      <description>Aang uses his staff to helicopter into the air. The king bends a large
                boulder into the ceiling, raining rocks onto Aang, knocking him from the air. He
                charges at the king on foot, but a series of bending attacks leaves him flat atop a
                large rock pile</description>

      <speech speaker="Bumi">You'll have to be a little more creative than that!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang bends an air scooter and charges forward on it, throwing a huge air
                blast at the king as he comes. The king throws up a stone barrier and the blast
                deflects to both sides of it.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">Did someone leave the windows open? It feels a little drafty in here. Are you hoping
            I'll catch a cold?</speech>

   <section>
      <description>The king bends more attacks at Aang, leading him across half of the
                arena.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">How are you going to get me from way over there?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang charges forward on foot again, using airbending to accelerate but the
                king softens the arena floor, leaving him sunk to the waist. The king bends two
                stones to collide on the spot but Aang pops out at the top of them when they meet.
                Visibly angry now, he bends the slab the king is standing on all the way to the back
                of the arena. The king bends the largest boulder yet to come at Aang from behind but
                he does an air-assisted back flip over it. The king makes more bending moves,
                cracking the floors and walls of the arena, tearing out a huge chunk of the wall and
                balcony they had been standing on. Seeing what is coming, Aang gasps and runs in
                tight circles, conjuring a tornado. When the king flings the huge piece at Aang, it
                is caught in the tornado and instantly whips around right back at the king. The king
                bends it to sand before it can smash him, but before he can recover, Aang attacks
                from the top of the tornado, landing at the king's feet with his staff poised to
                strike. The king's arms are raised as if surrendering but a small pebble strikes
                Aang's head, drawing his attention to the large boulder suspended over the both of
                them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Bumi">Well done, Avatar. You fight with much fire in your heart. <charAction>He tosses the
                boulder aside and bends up to the balcony where the two siblings are almost
                completely encased. Aang joins him.</charAction> You've passed all my tests. Now,
            you must answer one question.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">That's not fair! You said you would release my friends if I finished your
            tests.</speech>

            But I do have a reason. Aang, you have a difficult task ahead. The world has changed in
            the hundred years that you've been gone. It's the duty of the Avatar to restore balance
            to the world by defeating Fire Lord Ozai. You have much to learn. You must master the
            four elements and confront the Fire Lord. And when you do, I hope you will think like a
            mad genius. And it looks like you're in good hands. You'll need your friends to help
            defeat the Fire Nation. <charAction>Momo climbs up on Aang.</charAction> And you'll need
