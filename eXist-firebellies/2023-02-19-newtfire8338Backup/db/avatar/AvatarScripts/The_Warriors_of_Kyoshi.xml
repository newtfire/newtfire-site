      <description>The episode opens, depicting a clear, starry night sky, the camera panning
                downwards to the open sea where Zuko's ship sails through the water. Cut to shot of
                inside Zuko's bedroom, the camera panning to the right to portray the entirety of
                the room. Zuko is seen meditating in his cabin, his back to the camera. The glow of
                the four candles situated on a table steadily increases and decreases in time with
                the prince's relaxed inhalations and exhalations. Cut to frontal shot of Zuko
                sitting peacefully with his eyes closed, the four candles in view, continually
                brightening and dimming. Cut to side-view shot of Zuko's head, the door to his cabin
                in view. Iroh cracks open the door and peeks through while Zuko opens his
                eyes.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Calmly.</charAction> The only reason you should be interrupting me, is
            if you have news about the Avatar.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Pushes open the door completely and enters the room, holding a rolled up
                scroll in his hands.</charAction> Well, there is news, Prince Zuko, but you might
            not like it. Don't get too upset.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to shot of the prince sitting motionless, still assuming his
                meditative stance, his back to the camera. Calmly.</charAction> Uncle, you taught me
            that keeping a level head is a sign of a great leader. Now, whatever you have to say,
            I'm sure I can take it.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Frontal view of Zuko, Iroh tugging his small beard in the
                background.</charAction> Okay then. <charAction>Hesitatingly.</charAction> We have
            no idea where he is.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The flames of the candles suddenly erupt in a fiery mass, brushing the
                ceiling and obscuring Zuko from sight.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Enraged.</charAction> What!?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a wider shot of the room as Zuko rises to his feet, enraged. Iroh
                shields his face from the flames, and merely withdraws a fan from his robe and
                begins waving it to cool himself down.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">You really should open a window in here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>He snatches the scroll from Iroh's hand.</charAction> Give me the map!
                <charAction>He unrolls it, scanning over the parchment.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Well, there have been multiple sightings of the Avatar, but he is impossible to
            track down.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Desperately.</charAction> How am I going to find him, Uncle?
                <charAction>Cut to a shot of the map in Zuko's hand, several locations marked down
                with zigzagged lines connecting each point; Voice-over.</charAction> He is clearly a
            master of evasive maneuvering.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The shot of his map fades to a shot of the team's own map, minus the
                zigzagged lines, Sokka holding it in his hands. Cut to shot of him pouring over the
                map and questioning Aang's navigational skills.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>To Aang.</charAction> You have no idea where you're going, do
            you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to shot of the entire group mounted on Appa. The siblings are riding in
                his saddle while Aang sits atop his head, looking back. Appa's fur seems dirty and
                disordered.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Well ... <charAction>Happily.</charAction> I know it's near water.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to shot of Katara, who is preoccupied with sewing a hole in Sokka's
                pants, Aang glancing over at her from atop Appa's head, Momo perched on his
                shoulder. He concocts an idea to impress her.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Momo, marbles please. <charAction>Close-up of Momo who dives into his shirt and
                emerges, handing Aang two small, gray marbles.</charAction> Hey Katara, check out
            this airbending trick!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Using airbending, Aang manages to spin the two marbles quickly along an
                equatorial plane as he grins happily. Cut to side-view of Aang and Katara, Katara
                taking no notice and continues to sew.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Cut to shot of Katara and Sokka seated on Appa's saddle. Sokka waves his
                arm breezily at Aang as if he is trying to shoo him away.</charAction> Stop bugging
            her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Close side-view shot of Katara as she casts her brother an annoyed

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Cut to a shot of Sokka lazily resting with his arms behind his
                head.</charAction> Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are
            better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. <charAction>Cut back to an annoyed
                Katara.</charAction> It's just the natural order of things.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">

            great job I did!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara angrily tosses the pants in his direction. Cut to shot of Sokka as
                the pair of pants hit him in the face, covering it. He quickly scrambles to free
                himself.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Protesting and pleading.</charAction> Wait! I was just kidding.

            pants.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang yanks Appa's reins to the left, his tongue sticking out of the corner
                of his mouth. Appa picks up speed as he flies right passed the camera. Cut to an
                overview shot of an island covered with mountains. Switch to a far off shot of a
                beach, where Appa has landed and Team Avatar has dismounted.</description>
   </section>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cut to close frontal view of Aang who is looking at something, his hand
                held against his brow. The siblings stand in the background.</charAction> He's
            right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Camera moves back to reveal Appa as well. Innocently.</charAction> But
            Appa's tired, aren't you boy?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa does not react at all apart from a mild grunt, which comes across less
                than convincing.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Nudges Appa against his front leg with his elbow.</charAction> I
                said, &gt;aren't you boy?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa puts slightly more enthusiasm behind his response the second time by
                grunting louder and opening up his mouth wide as if he was yawning.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Aang smiles over his shoulder at the duo. Sarcastically.</charAction>
            Yeah, that was real &gt;convincing.<charAction>Somewhat
                fearfully.</charAction> Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical
            monster.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Runs toward the shore, takes a sharp breath and points.
                Excitedly.</charAction> Look!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to an overview shot of the bay. Aang is standing on the beach, pointing
                and looking at the water where an elephant koi jumps out the water and back in,
                creating a giant splash. Switch to a shot of the two siblings staring in awe at the
                giant fish. Cut to a view from behind Sokka and Katara with Aang visible between the
                back of their heads.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Excited.</charAction> That's why we're here. <charAction>Starts to
                disrobe while more koi fish jump out of the water in the background.</charAction>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a side-view of the coastline as Aang runs up and dives in. As soon
                as he submerges, he jumps out again.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Cold!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Switch to Katara and Sokka, still standing on shore, they exchange glances
                while Appa walks away, clearly taking interest in something else. Sokka makes a
                circular motion with his left hand around near his left temple, signaling to his
                sister that he thinks Aang is crazy. Cut back to Aang who is swimming toward the
                deep waters of the bay where the koi fish are. He dives under and immediately
                appears again, now holding on to the back fin of one of these giant animals as it
                jumps out of the water before diving again. Cut back to the siblings. Katara smiles
                broadly and impressed at the sight of Aang riding the koi fish while Sokka stares at
                the scene with an uninterested look upon his face and his arms crossed. Cut to a
                broader view, Sokka and Katara are with their back toward the camera. Momo is
                jumping excitedly up and down as Aang's koi fish reappears again.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Switch to a frontal view of Aang riding the koi. Two other koi jump out of
                the water behind him to the left and right. Aang is still laughing loud with
                excitement as they race through the water. Cut to an overview shot of the bay as the
                three koi playfully jump out the water before diving. Switch to an underwater shot
                of Aang and the fish. Cut to a shot of Katara and Sokka on the beach. Momo is still
                excitedly jumping up and down while Katara addresses her brother who still has his

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Notices something behind Sokka and runs off screen.</charAction> No,
            Appa. Don't eat that! <charAction>Appa grunts.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Switch back to a widely smiling Aang atop the fish, presumably in an
                attempt to impress Katara. Switches to off the shore from his perspective as Katara
                runs off inland. Close-up of Aang's disappointed face.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Disappointed, the smile having faded off his face.</charAction> Oh man

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cuts to overhead shot of the water, the backs of the three koi fish in
                view. Two koi fish suddenly change direction, including Aang's, swerving to the
                bottom-right of the screen, leaving behind one koi fish that continues to race
                forward. The camera pans up, the dark shadow of a large body appears beneath the
                water's surface directly behind the koi fish. Switch to a close shot of
                Sokka.</description>

                be pulled back under the surface by something unknown. Cut to a frontal shot of Aang
                still surfing on the koi fish's back, smiling widely, unaware of the danger. Katara
                reappears next to her brother again while Momo is screeching in alarm.</description>

                faded. He looks surprised at the commotion on the shore. Cut to shot of the shore
                from his perspective, Katara and Sokka motioning for him to exit the water by
                flailing their arms and calling to him from far away.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Switch back to a shot of Aang, who, believing them to be cheering him on,
                waves only to suddenly be hurled off the koi fish, into the water when the koi fish
                is being pulled under.</description>

      <description>Cut to wide-open shot of the lake, Aang plunging into the water as the koi
                fish he was mounted atop disappears under the water. Cut to Aang who resurfaces and
                gasps for breath as the massive dorsal fin of the unknown creature emerges from the
                surface directly behind him. Cut a wider shot of entire dorsal fin and a shot of
                Aang who turns around, suddenly alarmed by the sight.</description>

      <description>Cut to wide-view shot of the lake, the dorsal fin of the creature swerving
                off to the side as Aang uses airbending to run across the surface of the lake at
                lightning speed. Cut to a frontal shot of a heavily panting Aang fleeing the scene,
                his feet treading water, the creature following him in hot pursuit. Cut to overhead
                shot of the lake, Aang a mere speck in the water, a trail of white foam behind him,
                the creature gaining on him. Cut to shot of Sokka and Katara standing on the shore.
                Sokka suddenly grows alarmed as Aang collides straight into him, having reached the
                shore safely. Cut to shot of the entire lake and shore as the dorsal fin of the
                creature disappears beneath the surface. Katara runs to where her brother and Aang
                have come to a halt. Cut to shot of Sokka leaning against a tree trunk, a trail
                marking where his body slid across the ground. Aang is seen dressing himself as
                Katara and Momo approach the two.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The camera pans upward to where several female warriors clad in green
                kimonos descend from the treetops ambushing the trio. The women quickly encircle the
                group and take them out. Cut to Sokka who is being pulled back and knocked over.
                Switch to a shot of Katara with Aang in the background. Katara is pulled by her arm.
                As she leans in to maintain her balance, someone pulls her parka over her head and
                pulls her down. Aang is distracted by Katara's struggles, giving the opportunity to
                another female warrior to grab him by his collar. Momo flies up screeching from his
                shoulder, only to be quickly caught in a bag, only his head still protruding. Cut to
                a shot of the ground when a bound and blindfolded Momo, Aang, Katara, and Sokka are
                thrown on the ground in a line, each grunting when they hit the ground. They are
                surrounded by the female warriors.</description>

                of the back of a man while the scene pans to the left. The man addresses Aang,
                Sokka, and Katara who are still blindfolded and tied to a large wooden pole. The
                bagged Momo stands on the ground in front of Aang.</description>

                sells one of the fish to a servant, dressed in Fire Nation red. He too passes on the

      <description>The shot switches to a close-up of Kyoshi's statue's wooden face as it is
                being repainted. The right side of her face is already done and the previous cracks
                are not visible anymore. The painter carefully reapplies her left eyebrow with black
                paint. A back view shot of the statue shows the main street of Kyoshi village with
                houses at both sides and one bigger house at the end of the street. Another villager
                is cleaning the back of the statue with a broom. The camera pans to the right until
                the big house becomes the center of the shot before cutting to a shot of Appa who
                lazily lies on his side, eating hay while two villagers are grooming him. He growls
                and chews while the camera pans the left and up to focus on three open windows of
                the main house on the first floor. Cut to a side-view of inside the house where
                Aang, Katara, and Momo are sitting at a long table. A villager places another dish
                on the already richly filled table. Aang and Momo are very excited to see the

                cake and reaches across the table for the same dessert Aang just took. Aang glances
                to his left, over the hunched Katara to Sokka. Momo appears between Aang and Katara

      <description>Aang gets up and leans on the window sill so he can look better outside. As
                soon as he emerges, the villagers scream with delight and admiration for him. Aang
                looks down in surprise to see where the sound came from. The camera switches to his
                point of view and reveals a bunch a little girls cheering for him; Koko is among
                them in the front row. The camera cuts back to Aang who flashes a broad smile at the
                girls while blushing. Katara is standing behind him with her arms crossed in
                disapproval. She rolls her eyes and makes a raspberry.</description>
      <description>The shot changes to a side-view of a brownish-red bridge over a small
                creek. Aang quickly runs over it from the right to the left, trailed by four
                screaming fangirls. They run out of the picture, but Aang quickly comes back and
                traverses the bridge again, now from left to right. The girls are still following
                him, screaming loudly with the same amount of enthusiasm. They run out of the
                picture again, but once again, Aang runs back in. He runs up the bridge, but halts
                in the middle, looking from left to right as he sees that hordes of fangirls are
                trapping him on the bridge as they run up from both sides. Before they can reach
                him, the airbender leaps in the air. Cut to a closer shot of the girls in the middle
                of the bridge as they are still screaming and reaching for the sky. They gasp for
                air in admiration when they see that Aang is suspended in the air by clinging to an
                airball. The ball, however, slowly reduces in size until it vanishes completely.
                Aang looks scared as he drops down into the crowd of little girl who happily catch
                him.</description>
      <description>Switch to a shot of Aang and Koko standing serene with a waterfall in the

      <description>The painter lowers his canvas again and discovers that Aang is now
                surrounded by sixteen little girls. The camera switches to the annoyed face of the
                painter. As he stares at his models, his brush drips on his painting. Close shot of
                Aang and the fangirls as they all push and pull to be as close to Aang as possible.
                They are all smiling widely and giggling while Aang looks somewhat horrified by all
                the girls around him. A side-view of the scene shows that some girls are completely
                leaning on others in order to have a spot on the painting. The painter gets up and
                walks away without saying a word, while the tower of people crashes under its own
                weight.</description>
      <description>Switch to a shot of Aang and his fangirls back in the village. A frontal
                shot of the monk shows that he is doing push-ups while Momo is sitting on his back
                and his fangirls have lined up in a semi-circle behind him. After three push-ups,
                Aang starts to do one handed push-ups and soon switches to no handed push-ups, but
                pushing himself up with his airbending. The girls stare at him in admiration. Cut to
                a wider view as Katara walks past carrying a basket. A look of disapproval dons her
                face as she keeps on walking without even glancing at the Avatar.</description>

      <description>Inside the house, six Kyoshi Warriors are training. They are performing a

                and attacks the female warrior by trying to punch her. Suki does not move, but
                easily defends herself by bringing up her left arm and thrusting her closed fan
                against Sokka's shoulder. His cries out in pain and staggers backward.</description>

      <description>Suki quickly dodges under Sokka's outstretched leg and pushes him off

                lazily opens her fans to wave herself some air. Sokka, a little shocked by his
                second failure, loses his temper at the sight of Suki's defiant

                pushes against his shoulder with her left hand, quickly spinning him around. After
                two turns, she switches position and spins Sokka in the other direction. Close-up of
                Sokka's distressed face as he is powerlessly being tossed around. Switch to a wider
                shot as Suki suddenly halts Sokka so he topples forward. Before falling down, Suki
                loosens Sokka's belt and ties his left hand to his right foot behind his back in one
                swift movement. Sokka tries so maintain his balance for a while by jumping on one
                leg, but it is not long before he loses footage and smacks down flat on his

      <description>Aang angrily turns around to walk out of the door. Before he leaves,
                however, he already glances back to Katara with a sorrowful expression on his face.
                Right after he leaves the room, Katara crosses her arms in protection and glances at
                the door, looking sad as well. She turns her head and raises her eyes in a
                combination of annoyance and regret.</description>

                to a shot of the shore, where the last of the girls is leaving, but their place is
                taken by Katara who just arrived. Aang jumps up from the water and

   <section>
      <description>Side-view of Aang swimming to the shore, when suddenly a giant dorsal fin
                appears from out of the water behind him. Close-up of Katara as her eyes open in
                shock and she draws a sharp breath in horror. Cut back to Aang, who is, still
                oblivious to the danger behind him, swimming toward her with a smile on his face.
                Suddenly Aang is swept away by a wave and lifted out of the water, while he is
                screaming in panic. He looks around to find himself sitting on the back of Unagi as
                the monstrous eel erects itself before him, and directs a powerful jet of water to
                him. Aang withstands the water by holding on to one of the smaller dorsal fins of
                Unagi. The animal charges Aang and tries to eat him, but Aang narrowly escapes by
                catching one of Unagi's whiskers. Screaming his lungs out, he dangles from side to
                side in from of the big green eye of Unagi.</description>
      <description>Cut to a shot from inside Unagi's mouth, looking out as Aang comes to a
                halt right in front of him. The enormous tongue moves from side to side in
                anticipation of the meal. Cut to a broader shot of the two as Unagi suddenly and
                violently moves his head in all directions, trying to snatch Aang of his
                whisker.</description>

      <description>Close-up of a terrified Aang as he holds on to the whisker for dear life.
                Unagi tosses him some more from side to side, and Aang finally lets go from the
                force and speed of the throw. He is thrown through the air, still screaming loudly,
                and smacks in the water, not so far from where Katara is standing on the shore. He
                emerges back to the surface, clearly unconscious with his tongue out of his mouth.
                The camera pans up to show a heavily panting and fully clothed Katara entering the
                water.</description>

      <description>Unagi shrieks and dives under to get to his unconscious prey. Close-up of a
                worried Katara who is moving toward Aang through the water as fast as she can. The
                camera switches between shots of a rapidly approaching shadow underneath the water
                of Unagi, and a heavily panting Katara in her frantic effort to reach Aang before
                the eel. The moment Katara reaches Aang and takes him into her arm, Unagi emerges
                right in front of them. In an attempt to get away, Katara violently pushes the
                water, propelling herself and Aang backward with her waterbending; at the same time,
                Unagi snatches the water where they were just moments before. Although missing the
                duo, the impact of Unagi's attack creates a giant wave that slams Katara and Aang
                back to the rocks on shore. Angered, the animal spews power streams of water to the
                rocks before submerging again.</description>

                Zuko and his man ride past Katara and Aang's hiding place. Katara protectively
                covers the body of the still unconscious Aang, while worriedly looking up and
                hearing the riders move past. When she is certain the riders have pass, Katara lays
                Aang on his back.</description>

                roof. He has a collection of sweets with him which he is eating while watching the
                duo below him train. The camera moves closer to the duo on the ground, where Suki
                thrusts her hand, holding the fan forward, only to have it blocked by

                shot of two rhinos with their riders as one of the Kyoshi Warriors quickly passes
                them by behind some houses. Cut to a frontal view of the three rhinos, before
                switching to a shot of the running feet of a Kyoshi Warrior atop a snowy roof. When
                she pushes herself off, the scene switches to a frog view of the three rhinos and
                there riders as three Kyoshi Warriors come jumping toward them from atop nearby
                roofs, knocking off some of the riders. A Kyoshi Warriors lands in front of the lead
                rhino and opens her fans. The rider stabs at her with his spear. She moves to the
                right, disarms the rider, and jumps up to knock him off his steed with a spinning
                kick. Suki can be seen running past in the background.</description>
      <description>Cut to a frontal view of a concentrated Suki while she runs toward Zuko.
                Switch to a back view of Suki, who moves to the left to avoid a fire blast of the
                prince. She jumps over another blast and tries to attack Zuko from the air, but he
                turns his rhino. The beast slams Suki away with a might sweep of his tail, knocking
                her down. Zuko shoots a fire blast at the downed warrior, but right before it would
                have burned her, Sokka jumps before her and decimates the flames with a sweep of his
                fan. Sokka prepares to fight Zuko, but before he can do anything, another Kyoshi
                Warrior jumps of a nearby roof and knocks a surprised Zuko of his rhino; the beast
                dashes away.</description>

                other Kyoshi Warrior all take on a fighting stance. Zuko pushes himself up and
                rapidly spins around on his hand while shooting fire out of his feet, knocking the
                Kyoshi Warrior back into the house and slamming Suki against a wooden pole, where
                she collapses in pain. Zuko proceeds with a low fire kick in Sokka's direction. The
                Water Tribe Warrior jumps over the fire, but as soon as he lands again, Zuko sweeps
                his feet from underneath him. Sokka falls in his back, and Zuko jumps over him to
                the middle of the street. He angrily looks around. Camera moves back to reveal the

      <description>Zuko commences by sending two fire balls in Aang's direction. Back view of
                Aang as he prepares to face the incoming, burning projectiles. He ducks underneath
                the first and uses his staff to decimate the next fire ball. He rapidly spins the
                staff over his head, propelling himself in the air. He lands in front of Zuko, who
                immediately kicks the staff out of his hands. Aang jumps up and lands between two
                fans of a Kyoshi Warrior that are lying on the ground. He stands up and picks us the
                fan with his airbending. Close-up of Zuko, who madly charges Aang with his fist
                already held stretched out before him. Aang spins around a few times to create a
                bigger momentum and uses the extra power of his swirl to blast Zuko in a nearby
                house with a strong blast of air. Aang looks sad and lowers the fans. He runs down
                the main street and picks up his staff along the way. Aang tosses the object in the
                air, where it snaps open into his glider and jumps on. A close-up of a saddened
                Aang, switches to the scene he is seeing: a lot of burning houses and the Fire
                Nation troops among them. Aang looks back to see the burning statue of Avatar
                Kyoshi, which saddens Aang even more.</description>

      <description>Aang lands and Katara turns to face him as he walks over to
                her.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sorrowful.</charAction> Look what I brought to this place.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">It's not your fault.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Close-up. Upset.</charAction> Yes, it is. These people got their town
            destroyed trying to protect me.</speech>

      <description>Camera turns to Katara. Five little girls can be seen behind her in the
                house. Koko stands in the doorway holding Momo, whole the girl next to her peeks
                around the door frame with a worried look upon her face.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels
            wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sad.</charAction> I'll call Appa.</speech>

      <description>Cut to a Kyoshi Warrior who deflects a fire blast with her fan, and
                retaliates by throwing her other closed fan to the firebender. With a load clung,
                the object makes contact with the bender's helmet, knocking him on his behind. The
                camera moves backward through an ally. Two retreating Warriors can be soon,
                deflecting fire balls left and right, before the camera pans to the left, revealing
                Sokka and Suki squatting behind a house.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Close-up. Regretful.</charAction> I treated you like a girl when I
            should've treated you like a warrior.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Suki">
         <charAction>Side-view.</charAction> I am a warrior. <charAction>She leans over and
                kisses Sokka on the cheek, before continuing again. A surprised Sokka touches his
                cheek where Suki just kissed him.</charAction> But I'm a girl, too. <charAction>Cut
                to shot of Sokka who blushes; cut to Suki who stands in the alleyway, her fan slid
                open to fight.</charAction> Now get out of here! We'll hold them off.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka stands up and runs to Appa who was lying ready a few meters further.
                Both Momo and Sokka run up Appa's tale.</description>

      <description>Appa groans and takes off. A frog view shows how the bison flies over the
                burning buildings.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">Back to the ship! Don't lose sight of them!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko and his men turn and run toward the coast where their ship is
                docked.</description>
      <description>Cut to shot of the group flying away on Appa. Katara and Sokka are in the
                saddle, Aang on his head, and the burning village of Kyoshi is behind
                them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Peeking over the rim of the saddle to address a saddened Aang. Sokka is
                wiping of the face paint with his sleeve.</charAction> I know it's hard, but you did
            the right thing. <charAction>Gesturing toward the town.</charAction> Zuko would have
            destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. <charAction>Comforting.</charAction> They're
            going to be okay, Aang.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang looks up with a determined look on his face. The camera zooms in on
                him, when he suddenly jumps off Appa, the camera following his free
                fall.</description>

         <charAction>Shocked; off-camera.</charAction> What are you doing?</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to shot of the surface of the ocean as Aang plunges into the water.
                Switches back to a shot of Katara and Sokka, his face cleaned of the warrior
                make-up, peering over the edge of the saddle, wide-eyed in chock. Momo peeks over
                the rim as well beside Katara. Cut back to a shot of the surface, where a few
                ripples reveal the nearing emerging of something. The water bubbles and suddenly
                Unagi shoots out of the water with Aang on top of his head, holding his whiskers.
                After swaying about a few times, he sturdies himself atop Unagi's head and pulls the
                creature's barbels. Unagi opens its mouth wide and begins gushing water which rains
                over the town. Cut to shot of the village houses as the fires are put out by the
                rain. Cut to shot of a drenched Zuko and his men mounted on the rhinos, Zuko looking
                humiliated and his men looking surprised. Unagi ceases to gush water and launches
                Aang into the air, who is subsequently caught by an overflying Appa.</description>
      <description>Cut to shot of Oyaji viewing the spectacle from a building, his back to the
                camera. Switch to a frontal shot.</description>

         <charAction>Smiling as Aang sits down.</charAction> Yes, it was.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang whom Katara suddenly hugs. Aang smiles and inhales deeply
                before sighing and closing his eyes, happily. Cut to shot of the ocean, Unagi
                disappearing below the surface of the water.</description>
