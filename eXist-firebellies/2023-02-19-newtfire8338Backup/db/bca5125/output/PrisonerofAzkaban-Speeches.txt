 Lumos Maxima...

 Lumos Maxima... 
 Lumos... MAXIMA! 
 Harry! Harry bounds down the stairs and into the
    front hall, where his AUNT PETUNIA and cousin DUDLEY stand stiffly. Petunia flicks a bit of
    fluff from Dudley's sweater, glowers crossly at Harry, and jerks her head toward the door. Well,
    go on. 
 Open it. Harry reaches for the knob when -- BLAM! -- it BURSTS OPEN,
    revealing a LARGE, WADDLING WOMAN (AUNT MARGE) and a LARGE WADDLING BULLDOG (RIPPER). Uncle
    Vernon lurches forward out of the teeming RAIN, an ENORMOUS SUITCASE in hand, and drops it on
    Harry. 
 Marge! Welcome! How was the train? 
 Wretched. Ripper got sick. 
 Ah. How... unfortunate. 
 I would've left him with the others, but he pines so when I'm away. Don't
    you, darling? Aunt Marge puckers her lips at Ripper and leads him down the hallway. Harry
    follows with Uncle Vernon. 
 Uncle Vernon. I need you to sign this form. 
 What is it? 
 Nothing. Something for school... 
 Later perhaps. If you behave. 
 I will if she does. 

    
 So. Still here, are you? 
 Yes. 
 Donâ€™t say 'yes' in that ungrateful tone. Damn good of my brother to keep
    you, if you ask me. 
 It'd have been straight to an orphanage
    if he'd been dumped on my doorstep. 

   
 Is that my Dudders! Hm? Is that my neffy poo? Come and say hello to your
    Auntie Marge. 
 Can I tempt you, Marge? 
 Just a small one. A bit more... a bit more... That's the boy.
     
 Aah. Excellent nosh, Petunia. It's normally just a fry-up
    for me, what with twelve dogs. 

   
 What are you smirking at! Where is it that you send him, Vernon? 
 St. Brutus's. It's a first-rate institution for hopeless cases.
     

   
 I see. And do they use the cane at St. Brutus's, boy? 

    
 Oh, yes. I've been beaten loads of times. 
 Excellent. I won't have this namby-pamby wishy-washy nonsense about not
    hitting people who deserve it. 
 Still. Mustn't blame yourself for
    how this one's turned out, Vernon. It all comes down to blood. Bad blood will out. What is it
    the boy's father did, Petunia? 

    
 Nothing. That is... he didn't work. He was -- unemployed. 
 Of course. And a drunk, I expect - 
 That's a lie. 

   
 What did you say? 
 My dad wasn't a drunk. 
 Oh my goodness! Marge! 
 Not to worry, Petunia. I have a very firm grip. 
 You go to bed. Now. 
 Quiet, Vernon. It doesn't matter about the father. In the end it comes
    down to the mother. You see it all the time with dogs. If there's something wrong with the
    bitch, there'll be something wrong with the pup... 
 Shut up! Shut up! 
 MARGE! 
 Don't worry! I've got you... 
 Vernon. Don't you dare -
 YOU BRING HER BACK! YOU BRING HER BACK AND PUT HER RIGHT! 
 No! She deserved what she got! And you... you keep away from me. 
 You're not allowed to do magic out of school. They won't have you now.
    You've got nowhere to go. 
 Anywhere's better than here. 
 Aaaah! 

    
 Welcome to the Knight Bus. Emergency transport for the
    stranded witch or wizard. My name is Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this evening.
     
 Wha' choo doin' down there? 
 Fell over. 
 Wha' choo fall over for? 
 I didn't do it on purpose. 
 Well, come on then. Let's not wait for the grass to grow. 
 Not now... I'm pickling slugs... 
 Take 'er away, Ern. 
 Yeah, take it away! 
 Wot you say your name was again? 
 I didn't. 
 Whereabouts you headin'? 
 The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London - 
 Is it now? Get that, Ern? The Leaky Cauldron. That's in London. 
 Leaky Cauldron! Stay away from the pea soup! 
 Isn't this a bit... dangerous? 
 Naah. Haven't had an accident in -- what? -- a week is it, Ern? 
 Heads up! Little old lady at twelve o'clock! 
 Who is that? That man. 
 Who is that? That's Sirius Black, that is. Don' tell me you ne'er been
    hearin' o' Sirius Black? 
 A murderer, he is. Got 'imself locked up in Azkaban for it. 
 How'd he escape? 
 Tha's the question, isn't it? He's the firs' that's done it. Gives me
    the collywobbles thinking he's out there, though, I'll tell you that. Big supporter of YouKnow-'
    Oo, Black was. Reckon you heard o' him. 
 Yeah. Him I've heard of. 
 Hate that. 
 This bus. Don't the Muggles ever... 
 Them! Don' listen properly, do they? Don' look properly either. Never
    notice nuffink, they don'. 
 Turn! Turn! 
 Mr. Potter... at last. 
 
 Right smart bird you've got there, Mr. Potter. Arrived only minutes before
    yourself. A MAN CLEARS his throat. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE)
    at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass,
    but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from
    his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his palms. 
 I should tell you, Mr. Potter, earlier this evening your uncle's
    sister was located just south of Sheffield, circling a chimney stack. The Accidental Magic
    Reversal Department was dispatched and she's been properly punctured and her memory modified.
    She has no recollection of the incident whatsoever. 
 So that's that, and no harm done. 
 Pea soup?
     
 No thank you. Minister... I don't understand. I broke the law. Underage wizards
    aren't allowed to use magic at home - 

    
 Oh, come now, Harry. The Ministry doesn't send people to
    Azkaban for blowing up their aunts! On the other hand... running away like that... given the
    state of things... very, very irresponsible. 
 'The state of things' sir? 
 We have a killer on the loose. 
 Sirius Black, you mean. But... what's that got to do with me? 
 Hm? Oh, nothing. You're safe, that's what matters. Tomorrow you'll be
    on your way to Hogwarts. These are your new schoolbooks. I took the liberty of having them
    brought here for you. 
 By the way, Harry. Whilst you're here it would be best if you
    didn't... wander. 
 Housekeeping. 

    
 I'll come back later. 
 I'm warning you, Hermione! Keep that bloody beast of yours
    away from Scabbers or I'll turn it into a tea cozy. 
 He's a cat, Ronald! What do you expect? It's in his
    nature. As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY protectively cradling Scabbers, while
    HERMIONE GRANDER does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks. 
 A cat! Is that what they told you? Looks more like a pig with hair if you ask me. 
 That's rich coming from the owner of that smelly old shoe brush.
     
 It's all right, Crookshanks. You just ignore the mean little
    boy... 

   
 Harry. 
 Egypt! What's it like? 
 Brilliant. It's got loads of old stuff. Mummies. Death masks. Tombs - 
 You know, the ancient Egyptians of the Nile River delta worshipped the cat
    goddess Bast. 
 I also got a new wand. 
 Not flashing that clipping about again, are you, Ron? 
 I haven't shown anyone! 
 No, not a soul. Unless you count Tom. The day maid. The night maid. The cook.
    The bloke that came to fix the toilet. That wizard from Belgium... 
 It's good to see you, Harry. 
 Good to see you too, Mrs. Weasley. 
 Harry. I wonder if I might have a word. 
 Of course, Mr. Weasley. 
 George's nose looks positively massive in that photograph. 
 That's your nose, Fred. 
 Bloody hell. 'Tis, isn't it? Take after your side of the family, don't I, Mum?
     
 Harry. There are some within the Ministry who would strongly
    discourage me from divulging what I'm about to tell you. But I think you need to know the facts.
    Because you're in danger. Grave danger. 
 Has this anything to do with him, sir? 
 What do you know of Sirius Black, Harry? 
 That he escaped from Azkaban. That he killed someone... 
 Harry, thirteen years ago, when you stopped... 
 Voldemort...? 

    
 Black lost everything. But he remains a loyal servant to this
    day. In his mind, only you stand in the way of... 
 Voldemort...? 
 Harry, I hate it when you say - 
 I know, sorry. Ron hates it too. 
 In Black's mind, only you stand in the way of... You-Know-Who
    returning to power. That's why he's broken. That's why he's broken out of Azkaban. To find you.
    And... 
 Kill me? 
 Harry. I want you to swear that -- whatever you might hear - you won't
    go looking for Black. 
 Mr. Weasley, why would I go looking for someone who wants to kill me? 
 Just watch yourself, will you, Harry? 
 She hands Scabbers through the open window to him. 
 I didn't mean to blow her up. I just... (troubled by the memory) ... lost
    control. 
 Brilliant! 
 Honestly, Ron, it's not funny. Harry's lucky he wasn't expelled. 
 I still think it was brilliant. SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! A copy of the The Monster Book
    of Monsters SCUTTLES CRAB-LIKE down the aisle, pursued by NEVILLE LONGBOTTOM. Hi, Harry. 
 Ron. Hermione. 
 Hi, Neville. 

   
 C'mon. We're in here. 
 Who d'you reckon he is? 
 Professor R.J. Lupin. 
 You know everything. How is it she knows everything? 
 It's on his case. 
 Is he really asleep? 
 Seems to be. Why? What is it, Harry? 
 Close the door. 
 Let me get this straight. Sirius Black escaped from Azkaban to come after you?
    Yes. 
 
 But they'll catch Black, won't they? I mean... eventually? 
 Sure -- Of course, no one's ever broken out of Azkaban before and he's a raving,
    murderous lunatic... Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker. The train LURCHES,
    begins to SLOW. Hermione slides down the seat, pinning Ron against the window. They exchange an
    awkward glance, then Hermione carefully slides to the other end of the seat and glances at her
    WATCH. Frowns. 
 Why're we stopping? We can't be there yet... Harry rises, slides open the
    door, peers into the corridor. HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously.
    Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and...
   
 What's going on? 
 Dunno... Maybe we've broken down? 
 Ouch! Ron, that was my foot! 
 There's something moving out there. I think... people are coming aboard. 
 Bloody hell. What's happening? 
 Don't. Move. 
 Harry? Harry, are you all right? 
 Thanks. 
 Chocolate. Eat. It'll help. 
 What was that -- that thing? 
 A Dementor. One of the guards of Azkaban. It's gone now. 
 It was searching the train, Harry. For Sirius Black. 
 I need to have a word with the driver. Excuse me. 
 Eat. It'll help. 
 What happened to me? 
 Well, you sort of went... rigid. We thought maybe you were having a fit or
    something. 
 And did either of you? You know... pass out? 
 No. I felt... weird. Like I'd never be cheerful again. But... no. 
 I was trembling. Cold. But then... Professor Lupin made it go away... 
 But someone was screaming. A woman. 
 No one was screaming, Harry. 
 Welcome! Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few things to say,
    before we become befuddled by our excellent feast. I myself am particularly looking forward to
    the flaming kiwi cups, which, while somewhat treacherous for those of us with facial hair...
     
 Mm. Yes. First, I'm pleased to welcome Professor R.J. Lupin, who has
    kindly consented to fill the post of Defense Against the Dark Arts. Good luck to you, Professor.
     
 Of course! That's why he knew to give you the chocolate, Harry. 
 As some of you may know, Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical
    Creatures teacher for many years, has decided to retire in order to spend more time with his
    remaining limbs. Fortunately, I'm delighted to announce that his place will be filled by none
    other than our own Rubeus Hagrid! 

    
 Finally, on a more disquieting note, Hogwarts -- at the request
    of the Ministry of Magic -- will, until further notice, play host to the Dementors of Azkaban.
     
 The Dementors will be stationed at the entrances to the grounds. While
    they are under strict orders not to enter the castle itself, you will on occasion see them as
    you go about your daily activities. Under no circumstances are you to approach them. It is not
    in the nature of a Dementor to be forgiving. 
 Fortuna Major. 
 Good to be home, eh, Harry? 
 Yeah... 
 Welcome, my children. In this room, you shall
    explore the mysterious art of Divination. In this room, you shall discover if you possess...
     
 ... the Sight. Hello. I am Professor Trelawney. Together, we
    shall cast ourselves into the future. But know this. One either has the Gift or not. It cannot
    be divined from the pages of a book. Books only cloud one's Inner Eye. 

    
 What rubbish. 
 Where'd you come from? 
 Me? I've been here all along. 

    
 You, boy! Is your grandmother well? 
I...I think so. 
 I wouldn't be so sure of that. 
 The
    first term will be devoted to the reading of tea leaves. If all goes well, we will proceed to
    palmistry, fire omens, and finally... the crystal ball. 
 By the
    way, dear, beware a red- haired man. 
 Unfortunately, classes will be disrupted in February by a nasty
    bout of flu. I myself will lose my voice. And in late spring, one of our number will... leave us
    forever. 
 Well then. Shall we? 
 Broaden your minds, my dears. And allow your eyes to see...
    beyond. Trelawney takes Lavender Brown's cup, peers inside. 
 A five-leaf clover... You can expect to wake with a horrible rash
    tomorrow morning, dear. 
 Mr. Longbottom, after you've broken your
    first cup... 
 ... would you be so kind as to select one of the blue ones? I'm
    rather partial to the pink. 
 What do you see in Mr. Potter's cup,
    Mr. Weasley? 
 Well. He's got a wonky sort of cross -- that's trials and suffering. But this lot
    here could be the sun -- that's great happiness. So... he's going to suffer but be very happy
    about it. 
 Ahhh! 
 What is it, Professor? 
 My dear boy... You have the Grim. 
 The Grin? What's the Grin? 
 Not the grin, you idiot. The Grim. 
 But what does it mean, Professor? 
 'The Grim...' 
 'Taking the form of a giant spectral dog, it is among the darkest omens in
    our world. It is an omen... of death.' 
 Death omens. Honestly. If you ask me, Divination's a very wooly discipline.
    Now Ancient Runes. That's a fascinating subject. 
 Ancient Runes? Exactly how many classes are you taking this term? A fair few. 
 
 Hang on. Ancient Runes is the same time as Divination. You'd have to be in two
    classes at once. 
 Don't be silly. How could anyone be in two classes at once?
     
 Broaden your minds... 
 C'mon now, get a move on! Got a real treat for yeh. Great lesson comin' up.
    Follow me. 
 Gather 'round. Find yerself a spot. That's it. Now, firs' thing yeh'll want
    ter do is open yer books -DRACO And exactly how do we do that? 
 Crikey. Didn' yeh know? All yeh've got ter do is stroke 'em. Look --
 Righ' then. So... so... yeh've got yer books, an' now yeh need the Magical
    Creatures. Right. So... I'll... I'll go an' get 'em. 
 God, this place is going to the dogs. Wait until my father hears Dumbledore's
    got this oaf teaching classes. 
 Listen, you stupid prat -
 Potter, there's a Dementor behind you. 
 Gee up, there! 
 Beau'iful, isn' he? 
 Hagrid. Exactly what is that? 
 A Hippogriff, o' course. Now, firs' thing yeh gotta know is they're proud.
    Easily offended, Hippogriffs are. Don't never insult one, 'cause it migh' be the las' thing yeh
    do. Right then -- who wants ter come an' say hello? 
 Good man, Harry! 
 Tha's it. Easy now... stop! This here's Buckbeak, Harry. Yeh want ter let 'im
    make the firs' move. It's polite, see? Jus' take step forward, give 'im a bow, and if Buckbeak
    bows back, yeh're allowed ter touch him. Ready? 
 Back off, Harry! Back off! 
 Well done, Harry! Go on. Give 'im a pat. 
 Look at that! I reckon he migh' let yeh ride 'im! 

    
 Excuse me? 
 We'll jus' set yeh behind the wing joint. Mind yeh don' pull any feathers out.
    He won' like that. 
 Off yeh go! 
 Good work, Harry! 
 How'm I doin' me firs'
    day? 
 Brilliant... Professor. 
 Give me a go at that thing. If Potter can do it, it must be easy. You're not
    dangerous at all, are you, you great ugly brute -- Malfoy! No! 
 In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons SLASH DOWN. Malfoy freezes. Looks down at
    the BLOOD BLOSSOMING on his robes. SHRIEKS. Instantly, Harry dashes forward. Buckbeak WHIPS
    AROUND, raises its talons and -- seeing Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Harry... realizing
    what he's done... breathes. 
 It's killed me! It's killed me! Calm yerself! a scratch... 
 Yer fine... jus' Hagrid looks: arm. a DEEP GASH glistens on Draco's limp 
 Hagrid. He's got to be taken to a hospital. I'll go with you, if you like
    -HAGRID No. I'm the teacher. You all... you all just... Class dismissed! And with that, Hagrid
    -- looking shaken -- swoops up Malfoy, flops him over his shoulder, and lumbers toward the
    castle. 
 Does it hurt terribly, Draco? 

    
 It comes and goes. Still... I consider myself lucky. According
    to Madam Pomfrey, another minute or two... and I could've lost the arm. 
 The little git. He's really laying it on thick, isn't he? 
 At least Hagrid didn't get sacked. 
 Yes. But I hear Draco's father's furious. I don't think we've heard the end
    of this... 
 He's been sighted! 
 Who? 
 Achintee? That's not far from here... 
 You don't think he'd come to Hogwarts, do you? 
 With the Dementors at every entrance? 
 Dementors? He's already slipped by them once, hasn't he? Who's to say he
    can't do it again? 
 That's right. Black could be anywhere. It's like trying to catch smoke. Like
    trying to catch smoke with your bare hands. 
 Intriguing, yes? Would anyone like to venture a guess as to what's
    inside? 

    
 That's a Boggart, that is. 
 Very good, Mr. Finnigan. Can anyone tell us what a Boggart looks
    like? No one knows. 
 Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry. 
 When'd she get here? 
 Boggarts are shape-shifters. They take the shape of whatever a particular
    person fears most. That's what makes it so - 
 Terrifying, yes. Luckily, a very simple charm exists to repel a
    Boggart. Let's practice it now, shall we? Without wands, please... Riddikulus! 
 Riddikulus! 

    
 It's this class that's ridiculous. 
 Good. So much for the easy part. You see, the incantation alone is
    not enough. What really finishes a Boggart off is... laughter. You need to force it to assume a
    shape you find truly amusing. Neville, come up here, will you? 
 What would you say is the thing that frightens you most? 
 Profter... Snafpt... 
 Didn't catch that, Neville, sorry. 
 Professor Snape. 
 Hmmm... yes. Neville, I believe you live with your grandmother? 
 Yes, but I don't want the Boggart to turn into her either. 
 It won't. But I want you to picture her clothes, only her clothes,
    very clearly in your mind. Can you do that? 

    
 She carries a red handbag... 
 That's fine. We don't need to hear it. If you see it, we will. Now,
    when I open this wardrobe, Neville, here's what I want you to do... 
 You can do this, Neville. 
 Right then. Wand at the ready. One. Two. Three! 
 Think, Neville. Think! 
 R-r-riddikulus! 
 Ron! Forward! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Parvati! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Mr. Thomas! As Dean steps up, the vampire's undulating body
    attenuates, its skin darkening with diamond-thatched SCALES becoming... a GIANT COBRA. 
 Riddikulus! 
 Next! 
 Here! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Well done, everyone. I think that's enough excitement for today.
     
 Remember! These visits to Hogsmeade Village are a privilege. Should your
    behavior reflect poorly on the school in any way, that privilege shall not be extended again.
     
 No permission form.
    No visiting the Village. That's the rule, Potter. 
 Yes, Professor, but I thought if you said I could go - 
 But I don't say so. A parent or guardian must sign, and since I am
    neither, it would be inappropriate. 
 I'm sorry, Potter. But
    that's my final word. 
 So. No Hogsmeade, eh ? 
 Well, don't feel too bad. I was roundly disappointed the first time I
    went. Really? 
 
 No. I was just trying to make you feel better. Honeydukes' sweets are
    the best in the world. Their Pepper Imps are so strong you smoke at the ears. And Zonko's Joke
    Shop may be dangerous, but you can't beat their Stink Pellets. 

    
 Not to mention The Shrieking Shack, which, according to
    Hermione, is the most severely haunted building in Britain. 
 Yes, that too... 
 Professor, can I ask you something? 
 You'd like to know why I stopped you from facing the Boggart.
     
 I should think it'd be obvious. I assumed the Boggart
    would take the shape of Lord Voldemort. 
 But clearly... I was wrong. 
 I did think of Voldemort first. But then, I remembered that night on the
    train... and the Dementors... 
 Well, well. I'm impressed. That suggests that what you fear most of
    all is... fear. Very wise. 
 Before I fainted... I heard something. A woman. Screaming. 
 Dementors force us to relive the worst memories of our lives. Our
    pain becomes their power. 
 I think it was my mother. The night she was murdered. 
 The first time I saw you, Harry, I recognized you immediately. Not by
    your scar. By your eyes. They're your mother Lily's. 
 Yes. I knew her.
    She was there for me at a time when no one else was. We used to talk for hours. She was not only
    a singularly gifted witch but an uncommonly kind woman. She had a way of seeing the beauty in
    whoever she met, even -- and perhaps most especially -- when that person couldn't see it in
    themselves... 
 Which perhaps explains her affection for your father. James had,
    shall we say, a certain talent for trouble. A gift, rumor has it, he passed on to you. 
 I could tell you stories -- and there are many about your parents,
    Harry -- but know this... 
 They lived. Every moment of
    every day. You should know that. That's how they'd want to be remembered. 
 And the post office! It's about owls, all sitting on color- coded shelves,
    depending on how fast you want your letter to go! 
 And Honeyduke's is brilliant! Sugar Quills, Flaming Whizbees -and blood-flavored
    lollipops for Halloween! 
 But, I mean, after awhile, it got a bit boring. Don't you think, Ron? 
 Huh? Oh. Yeah. Dead depressing. Hang on. I almost forgot. I got you something
    wicked at Dervish and Banges. It's a Pocket Sneakoscope. 
 If there's someone untrustworthy around, it's meant to light up and spin. Mind
    you, Fred and George say it's rubbish, sold for wizard tourists, but I thought, you know, it
    can't hurt, given that... 
 Sirius Black's trying to kill me. 
 I'm glad you had a good time. Really. And thanks for this. 
 Rubbish or not, you're right. It can't hurt. 
 Oh, careful of those, they'll make your... 
 Never mind. 
 What's the hold-up? Only Neville ever forgets the password. 

    
 Let me through, please. Excuse me, thank you, I'm Head Boy...
     
 Back! All of you! No one is to enter this dormitory until it has
    been fully searched! 
 The Fat Lady... she's gone. 
 Probably stuffing her face with the apples in that still life on the second floor
    again. 
 No. You don't understand -
 Mr. Filch. Round up the ghosts. Tell them to search every painting in the
    castle for the Fat Lady. 
 There'll be no need for ghosts, Professor... 
 Dear lady. Who did this to you? 

    
 Eyes like the devil he's got. And a soul as dark as his name. It
    was him, Headmaster. The one they talk about. He's here. Somewhere in the castle. Sirius Black.
     
 I've done the dungeons, Headmaster. No sign of Black. Nor anywhere else in the
    castle. 

    
 I didn't really expect him to linger. 
 Remarkable feat, don't you think? To enter Hogwarts castle on one's own,
    completely undetected... 
 You may recall, prior to the start of term, I did express my concerns when you
    appointed Professor - 
 I do not believe a single professor inside this castle would have helped
    Sirius Black enter it, Severus. 
 No... I feel quite confident the castle is safe. And I'm more than willing
    to let the students return to their Houses. But tomorrow. For now, let them sleep... 
 It's astonishing what the body can endure when the mind allows itself to
    rest. 
 What villains are these that trespass upon my private
    lands! 
 Who dares challenge Sir Cadogan! Back, you scurvy braggarts! You rogues! 
 He's barking mad! 
 What d'you expect? After what happened to the Fat Lady, none of the other
    pictures would take the job. 
 But he keeps changing the password. Twice just this morning! I've taken to
    keeping a list. 
 Farewell, comrades! If ever you have need of noble heart and steely
    sinew, call upon Sir Cadogan! 
 Yeah, we'll call you... if we ever need someone mental. 
 Turn to page 394.
 Excuse me, sir, but... where's Professor Lupin? 
 That's not really your concern, is it, Potter? Suffice it to say, your
    Professor finds himself incapable of teaching at the present time. Page 
 Werewolves? 
 But, sir, we've only just begun learning about Red Caps and Hinkypunks.
    We're not meant to start nocturnal beasts for weeks - 
 Quiet! 

    
 When did she come in? Did you see her come in... 
 Now. Which of you can tell me the difference between an Animagus and a
    werewolf? 
 No one? How... disappointing. 
 Please, sir, an Animagus is a wizard who elects to turn into an animal. A
    werewolf has no choice in the matter. Furthermore, the werewolf actively hunts humans and
    responds only to the call of its own kind -- Malfoy lets out a LOW HOWL. 
 Quiet, Malfoy! Though one must admit to feeling your pain. That is the second
    time you have spoken out of turn, Miss Granger. Tell me. Are you incapable of restraining
    yourself? Or do you take pride in being an insufferable know-it-all? 

    
 He's got a point, you know. 
 Five points from Gryffindor! 
 As a antidote to
    your ignorance, I prescribe two rolls of parchment on the werewolf by Monday morning, with
    particular emphasis placed on recognizing it. 
 Passing notes, Potter?
     
 Not exactly Picasso, are you? I hope you demonstrate more talent on the
    Quidditch pitch this weekend then you do as an artist. If not, I fear you'll perish, given the
    weather forecast. Until that time, however, you'll forgive me if I don't let you off homework.
    Should you die, I assure you... you need not hand it in. 
 Come on! Faster! 
 No!!! 
 Looks a bit peaky, doesn't he? 
 Peaky? What d'you expect him to look like? He fell fifty feet. 
 Yeah, c'mon, Ron. We'll walk you off the Astronomy Tower and see how you come
    out looking. 
 Probably a right sight better than he normally does. 
 Harry! How're you feeling? 
 Brilliant. 
 Gave us a right good scare, mate. 
 What happened? 
 You fell off your broom. 
 Really? I meant the match. Who won? 
 No one blames you, Harry. The Dementors aren't meant to come on the grounds.
    Dumbledore was furious. After he saved you, he sent them straight off. 
 There's something else you should know, Harry. Your Nimbus -- when it blew away?
    -- it sort of landed in the Whomping Willow. And well... 
 I'm sorry about your broom, Harry. There's no
    chance of fixing it? 
 Why do they affect me so, Professor? I mean, more than everyone else... 
 Dementors are among the foulest creatures that walk this earth. They
    feed on every good feeling, every happy memory, until a person is left with nothing but his
    worst experiences. You're not weak, Harry. The Dementors affect you most, because there are true
    horrors in your past. Horrors your classmates can scarcely imagine. You have nothing to be
    ashamed of. 
 I'm scared, Professor. 
 I'd consider you a fool if you weren't. 
 I need to learn how to fight them. You could teach me, Professor. You made that
    Dementor on the train go away... 
 There was only one that night... 
 But you made it go away. 

    
 I don't pretend to be an expert, Harry. But yes, I can teach you.
    Perhaps after the holiday. For now, though, I need to rest. I'm feeling... tired. Harry turns,
    studies Lupin's haggard face. A weary smile appears as Hedwig's reflection glides over Lupin's
    irises. Beautiful... 
 Harry looks up, watches Hedwig pinwheel through the blue, past the
    CLOCK TOWER and EXIT FRAME. CAMERA HOLDS, the skies PALES, and SNOW begins to fall. We TILT
    DOWN... 
 Clever, Harry. 
 But not clever enough. 
 Besides, we've got a better way. 
 What's this rubbish? 
 Rubbish he says. That there's the secret to our success. 
 It's a wrench giving it to you, believe me. 
 But we've decided your need's greater than ours. George, if you will... 
 I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. George touches his wand to the
    parchment and INTRICATE INK LINES surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. Harry
    reads the CURIOUS WORDS at the top: 
 'Messrs Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs are proud to present The Marauder's
    Map'...? 
 Ah... Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs. We owe them so much. 
 Hang on. This is Hogwarts! And that... No. Is that really... Harry points to a
    small MOVING DOT labeled "Dumbledore." 
 Dumbledore. 
 In his study. 
 Pacing. 
 Does that a lot. 
 You mean, this map shows... 
 Everyone. 
 Everyone? 
 Everyone. 
 Where they are. 
 What they're doing. 
 Every minute. 
 Of every day. 
 Brilliant! Where'd you get it? 
 Nicked it from Filch's office, of course, first year. Now listen. There's seven
    secret passageways out of the castle. But we'd recommend... 
 This one. 
 The One-Eyed... 
 Witch, right. But you best hurry. Filch is heading this way. 
 Oh. And, Harry? When you're done, make sure to give it a tap and say, 'Mischief
    managed.' Otherwise, anyone can read it. 
 Dissendium? 
 Mischief managed. 
 A box of Jelly Slugs as well, Horace. We're nearly cleared
    out. HORACE grunts, begins moving boxes. Harry looks up to the cellar door, takes out the
    invisibility cloak... 
 It's meant to be the most haunted building in Britain. Did I mention that?
    Twice. 
 
 Should we move a bit closer? Huh? 
 Oh... All right... 
 Actually, it's fine from here. 
 Perfect. 
 Well, well. Look who's here. You two shopping for your dream home? Seems a bit
    grand for you, Weasel- Bee. Don't your family all sleep in one room? 
 Shut your mouth, Malfoy. 

    
 Now that's not very friendly. Boys, I think we're going to
    have to teach Weasel-Bee to respect his superiors. 

    
 Hope you don't mean yourself. 
 How dare you speak to me, you filthy, little mud -
 Who did that! 
 Well, don't just stand there! 
 Wait a minute, there's something out here -- Aaaaaaahhhh!!! 
 Harry...? Harry? 
 Bloody hell, Harry! That was not funny! 
 Those weasels! Never told me about any Marauder's Map! 
 But Harry isn't going to keep it. He's going to turn it over to Professor
    McGonagall, aren't you? 
 Oh sure. Along with his invisibility cloak, his pack of exploding snap cards, his
    - 
 Oh, shut up. 
 Rosmerta, m'dear! 
 That's Madam Rosmerta. Ron fancies her. 
 It's not true! 
 Shhh. 
 I trust business is good? 
 It'd be a right sight better if the Ministry wasn't sending Dementors
    into my pub every other night. 
 We have a killer on the loose. 
 Sirius Black? In Hogsmeade! And what would bring him here? 
 Harry Potter. 
 Harry Potter! 
 Harry? 
 So I says to him, 'Careful, Ned. Don't want to go losing your head!' 
 Come on then. Let's hear it. 
 Years ago, when Harry Potter's parents were marked for death, they went
    into hiding. Few knew where they were. One who did was black. And he told... 
 You-Know-Who. I've heard this rot. It was all over The Daily Prophet
    back in the day. And I'll say now what I said then: Of all the boys I ran out of here, Black's
    the last who would've gone over to the dark side. Hearsay. That's all the Ministry had. Hearsay. 
 Ha! Tell that to Peter Pettigrew! 
 Peter Pettigrew? 
 Little lump of a boy? Always tagging after Black and... 
 I remember him. What's he got to do with it? 
 After the Potters were killed, Pettigrew went looking for Black. And,
    unfortunately... found him. 
 Black was vicious. He didn't kill Pettigrew. He destroyed him. A
    finger. That's all that was left. A finger -- there's your hearsay. Rosmerta looks to
    McGonagall. She nods grimly. 
 Sirius Black may not have put his hands to the Potters, but he's the
    reason they're dead. And now he wants to finish what he started. 
 Harry. 
 But that's not the worst of it. 
 What could be worse? 
 This: Sirius Black was and remains today... Harry Potter's godfather.
     
 He was their friend. And he betrayed them. He was their friend. 
 I hope he finds me. But when he does, I'm going to be ready. When he does,
    I'm going to kill him. 
 You're sure about this, Harry? This is very advanced magic. Well
    beyond Ordinary Wizarding Level. 
 If Black can fight the Dementors, I need to know how too. 
 Very well. The spell I'm going to teach you is called the Patronus
    Charm. Ever hear of it? 
 A Patronus is a kind of positive force. For the wizard who can
    conjure one, the Patronus works something like a shield. The Dementor feeds on it instead of
    him. 
 But in order for it to work, you must think of a memory. And not just
    any. This memory needs to be a very happy one. And powerful. 
 Got something? Good. Let it fill you up. Lose yourself in it. Then
    speak the incantation: Expecto Patronum. Without your wand... 
 Expecto Patronum... 
 Right then. Shall we? 
 Concentrate, Harry. Concentrate... 
 Expecto... Patronum... 
 Expecto... Expecto... 
 Here! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Quickly. 
 That's one nasty Dementor. 
 Boggart, Harry. The real thing would be much, much worse. Just out of
    interest, what were you thinking of? What memory did you choose? 
 The first time I rode a broom. 
 That's not good enough, Harry. Not nearly. 
 There's another. It's not happy exactly. I mean, it is. It's the happiest I've
    ever felt. But it's... complicated. 
 Is it strong? 
 Then let's try it. 
 Think, Harry, think - 
 Just do it! 
 Expecto Patronum! 
 Riddikulus! 
 Well done. 
 
 I think I've had enough. today. For Lupin nods. Watches Harry move to the door. 
 So you know, Harry: You'd have given your father a run for his money.
    And, believe me, that's saying something. Harry ponders this. Then speaks, deep inside himself. 
 I was thinking of him. And Mum. Seeing their faces. They're just talking to me.
    Just... talking. That was the memory I chose. I don't even know if it's real... 
 But it's the best I have. 
 Aaaahhhh! 
 Everybody out! 
 Show yourself. 
 Ron! Ron! 
 Is he gone? 
 That's preposterous, Weasley. How could Sirius Black possibly have got
    through the portrait hole? 
 I don't know how he got in! I was a bit busy dodging his knife! 
 And this bloody cat ate my rat! 
 That's a lie! 
 It is not and you bloody well know it! 
 Silence! 
 Sir Cadogan. Is it possible that you let a mysterious man enter Gryffindor
    Tower tonight? 
 Certainly, good lady! He had the 
 Which abysmally foolish person wrote down the passwords and then proceeded
    to lose them! 
 Is it always going to be you, Longbottom? 
 I'm afraid so, ma'am. 

    
 While we know Sirius Black is gone tonight, I think you
    can safely assume he will, at some future time, attempt to return. Let me be clear. You are not
    to move about the castle alone. And you are not to write down the password! Understood! 
 Very well then. Go to bed. 
 I could've killed him. 
 He was right there. Close enough to touch. I could've killed him. 
 I find it astonishing that someone who prides herself on being so logical can be
    in such denial. 
 Harry. Will you explain to your friend Ronald that he has absolutely no
    proof whatsoever that my sweet, unassuming cat ate his shabby, decidedly decrepit rat. 
 Harry was there! He'll tell you how it was. Go on, Harry, tell her. 
 No, I won't. Know why? Because I don't care about your stupid rat! I don't care
    about your stupid cat! I've got few other things on my mind right now! 
 Really? Wasn't you had to roll under the bed last night to avoid getting cut to
    ribbons! A person could die being your friend, Harry! 
 How'd it go, Hagrid? 
 Buckbeak liked London. 
 I meant the hearing. 
 Oh. That. Well, I got up an' said my bit -- You know, how Buckbeak was a good
    Hippogriff an' as long as yeh treated 'im with respect, he'd treat you the same. Then Lucius
    Malfoy got up an' said his bit -- you know, how Buckbeak was a deadly dangerous beast that no
    teacher in their righ' mind would expose their students to... 

    
 And...? 
 You mustn't blame yourself, Hagrid. 
 Draco. It's him the Committee should punish. It's him they should send off to the
    forest, not Buckbeak. 
 Buckbeak's not going back to the forest... 

    
 Where's he going, Hagrid? 
 He asked fer the worse, yeh see, Lucius Malfoy did. An' the Committee granted
    it. Buckbeak's bin sentenced ter death. 
 I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. 
 Watch it there, boy! 
 Mischief managed! 
 Potter. What're you doing wandering the corridors at night? 
 I was... I was... sleepwalking... 
 How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter. He, too, was exceedingly
    arrogant. Strutting about the castle - 
 My dad didnâ€™t strut. Nor do I. Now, if you don't mind, I'd appreciate you
    lowering your wand. 
 Turn out your pockets. 
 Turn out your pockets! 
 And this. What might it be? 
 Spare bit of parchment... 
 Really... 
 Reveal your secret! 
 Read it. 
 'Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot and Prongs offer their compliments to
    Professor Snape and...' 
 Go on. 
 '... and request that he keep his abnormally large nose out of other people's
    business.' 

    
 Why you insolent little - 
 Professor...? 

   
 Well, well. Lupin. Out for a little walk in the moonlight, are we? Harry? 
 You all right? 
 That remains to be seen. I've just now confiscated a rather curious artifact
    from Mr. Potter. Take a look, Lupin. This is supposed to be your area of expertise. 
 Clearly, it's full of Dark Magic. 
 I seriously doubt that, Severus. It looks to me as if it merely
    insults anyone who tries to read it. I suspect it's a Zonko product. Nevertheless, I shall
    pursue any hidden qualities it may possess. As you say, it's my area of expertise. Come, Harry.
   
 I don't know how this map came to be in your possession, Harry, but
    I'm astounded that you didn't turn it in. Did you ever stop to think that this -- in the hands
    of Sirius Black -- is a map to you? 
 Your father didn't set much store by rules either. But he and your
    mother did give their lives to save yours. Gambling their sacrifice by walking about the castle
    unprotected, with a killer on the loose, strikes me as a poor way to repay them. I won't cover
    up for you again, Harry. 
 Professor. Just so you know, I don't think the map always works. Earlier, it
    showed someone in the castle. Someone I know to be dead. 

    
 And who was that, Harry? 
 Peter Pettigrew. 
 Very well. I'd like you to return to your dormitory now. Oh, and
    Harry? Don't take any detours. 
 If you do. I'll know. 
 Relax... Let your mind... go... 
 Crystal-gazing requires that you clear the Inner Eye. Only then,
    will you... See. Oh my, what do we have here...? 
 Here we go again. It's the Grim! It's the Grim! 

    
 My dear, from the moment you first arrived in my class, I sensed
    that you did not possess the proper spirit for the noble art of Divination. You may be young in
    years, but the heart that beats beneath your bosom is as shriveled as an old maid's, your soul
    as dry as the pages of the books to which you so desperately cleave. 
 'In late spring, one of our number will leave us forever!' You knew,
    Professor! You saw. 
 On these occasions, I take no joy in my gift, Miss Brown. 
 She's gone mental, Hermione has. I mean, not that she wasn't always mental, but
    now it's out in the open for everyone to see... 
 Professor Trelawney - 
 He will return tonight.... 
 S-sorry? 
 Tonight, when the clock strikes twelve, the servant shall break
    free. He and his Master shall be reunited. It cannot be prevented. 
 So sorry, dear boy. Did you say something? Her voice is normal
    once more. Harry shakes his head. 
 No. Nothing. 
 I can't believe they're going to kill Buckbeak! It's too horrible. 
 It just got worse. 
 Did you see the big, fat blubbering oaf?! Oh, this is going to be rich. Did I
    tell you, Father said I can keep the head - 
 Ah. Come to see the
    show? 
 You... foul... loathsome... evil... little cockroach... 
 Hermione! No! 
 He's not worth it. 
 That felt good. 
 Look at 'em. Loves the smell o' the trees when the wind blows... 
 I say we set him free. 

    
 They'd know I did it. And tha' would only get Dumbledore in
    trouble. Gonna come down, yeh know. Says he wants ter be with me when it... when it happens.
    Great man, Dumbledore. 
 We'll stay with you too, Hagrid. 
 Yeh will not! Think I wan' yeh seein' a thing like this! No. Yeh'll drink yer
    tea an' be off. But before yeh do -- I wan' ter see you an' Ron shake hands, Harry. 
 Thin' I haven' seen 'ow it's bin betw'n you two? Go on now... 
 Good. Now then. Ron, I wan' ter see you give Hermione a hug. 
 What! 
 Go on! You two've been at it all year. An' I'm sick o' it. 
 Crikey, tha's jus' abou' the most pathetic hug I e'er seen. But yeh did it,
    an' tha's wha' matters. There's jus' one other thing... 
 I'm not kissing Fang if that's what you're thinking... 
 Scabbers! You're alive! 
 Yeh should keep a closer eye on yer pets, Ron. 
 I think you owe someone an apology. 
 Right. Next time I see Crookshanks, I'll let him know. 
 I meant me. 
 Crikey. Here we go agin... 
 Ow! 
 Hagrid... 
 Yeh got to go! It's almost dark. Anyone sees yeh outside the castle it'll be
    trouble! Big trouble! 'Specially you, Harry -
 C'mon. 
 What? 
 Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. 
 He bit me... 
 Ron! No! 
 Harry. You do realize what tree this is... 
 Now behave yourself. 
 That's not good. 
 Ron! Run! 
 Harry! Run! 
 Aaaahhh! 
 I've got you -
 Harry! 
 Hold on, Ron! 
 No, Ron... 
 Nooooo!!! 
 Haaaaaaarrrrrr!!!!!!!!! 
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
 Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! 
 Thanks. 
 Don't mention it. Lumos. 
 Where do you suppose this goes? 
 I have a hunch. I just hope I'm wrong... 
 We're in the Shrieking Shack, aren't we? 
 Nox. 
 Ron! You're okay - 
 The dog -- where's the - 
 It's a trap, Harry. He's the dog. He's an Animagus... 
 If you want to kill Harry, you'll -- you'll... have to kill us, too! 
 No. Only one will die tonight. 
 Then it'll be you! 
 Harry! No! 
 Going to kill me, Harry? 
 Yes. 

   
 Professor Lupin! 

   
 Looking a bit ragged, aren't we, Sirius? Finally the skin reflects
    the madness within. 
 You'd know all about the madness within, wouldn't you, Remus? 
 No! I trusted you! I covered up for you. And all this time you've been his
    friend! 
 He's a werewolf! That's why he's been missing classes! 
 How long have you known? 
 Since Professor Snape set the essay. 
 You're the brightest witch of your age I've ever met, Hermione. 
 Yes, you glow like the sun. And you howl at the moon. Enough talk! He
    dies. Now. If you won't do it with me, Remus, I'll do it alone. 
 Wait, Sirius - 
 I did my waiting! Twelve years of it! In Azkaban! Trust me, you wouldn't
    have lasted a week! 
 All right then. As you wish... 
 No! 
 You betrayed my parents! You sold them to Voldemort! 
 It's a lie! I never would've betrayed James and Lily! 
 Harry! You've got to listen - 
 Did he listen! When my mother was dying! Did he hear her screaming! 
 No! I wasn't there! And I'll regret it the rest of my life! Harry's eyes
    flash to Black's, glittering with pain. 
 Someone else betrayed your parents, Harry. Someone in this room right
    now. Someone who, until quite recently, I believed to be dead. 
 He's as good as dead. 
 What're you talking about? There's nobody here. 
 Oh yes there is... 
 Come out, come out, Peter Come out, come out and play... 
 You're mad... 
 Expelliarmus! 

    
 Ah, vengeance is sweet. How I hoped I'd be the one to catch you. 
 Severus - 
 I told Dumbledore you were helping your old friend into the castle. And here's
    the proof. 
 Brilliant! And -- as usual -dead wrong. Now give us our wands back.
    Remus and I have a bit of unfinished business to tend to. 
 Give me a reason. I beg you. 
 Don't be a fool, Severus! 
 He can't help it. It's habit by now. 
 Quiet, Sirius! 

    
 Listen to you two. Quarreling like an old married couple.
    The creature and the criminal. 
 Piss off. 
 Witty as ever I see. Tell me, will you be so irreverent when I turn you over to
    the Dementors? 
 Do I detect a flicker of fear? One can only
    imagine what it must be like to endure the Dementor's Kiss. It's said to be unbearable to
    witness. But I'll do my best. 
 After you. 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Harry. You attacked a teacher. 
 You said Peter before. Peter who? 
 Pettigrew. He was at school with us. We thought he was a friend. 
 No. Pettigrew's dead. He killed him. 
 I thought so, too. Until you mentioned seeing Pettigrew on the Map. 
 The Map was lying then - 
 The Map never lies. Pettigrew's alive. And he's right there. 
 M-me? It's lunatic... 
 Not you, you idiot. Your rat. 
 Scabbers? Scabbers has been in my family for - 

    
 Twelve years. A curiously long life for a common garden rat. He's
    missing a toe, isn't he? 
 So what? 
 All they could find of Pettigrew was his - 
 Finger. Dirty coward cut it off so everyone would think he was dead.
    Then he transformed into a rat. 
 Show me. 
 What are you going to do to him? 
 Together. 
 
 S-Sirius... R-Remus. My old friends. 
 Harry! Look at you! Y-you look just like your father. Like James. We were
    the best of friends, he and I - 
 Shut up! 
 I didn't mean to! The Dark Lord, you have no idea the weapons he possesses!
    Ask yourself what you would have done, Sirius. What would you have done! 
 Died! Died rather than betray my friends! And you should have realized,
    Peter, if Voldemort didn't kill you... 
 We would. 
 No... please... you can't... 
 Ron!
    Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You won't let them kill me, will you? I was your
    rat... 
 Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them... 
 No. 
 Harry, this man... 
 I know what he is. But we'll take him to the castle. 
 Bless you, boy! Bless you - 
 Get off! I said we'd take you to the castle. After that, the Dementors can have
    you. 
 Turn me into a maggot. A dung beetle. A Flobberworm! Anything but the
    Dementors... 
 Ron! Haven't I been a good friend? A good pet? You
    won't let them kill me, will you? I was your rat... 
 Don't worry. He's under the Somnambulist Charm. It's primarily used to
    transport the seriously deranged. 
 Sweet girl. Clever girl. Surely you won't let them... 
 Beautiful, isn't it? I'll never forget the first time I walked through
    those doors. It'll be nice to do it again. Freely. 
 That was a
    noble thing you did back there. He doesn't deserve it. 
 I don't reckon my father'd want his best friends to become killers for a
    worthless piece of vermin like Pettigrew. Besides: Dead, the truth dies with him. Alive...
    you're free. 
 I don't know if you know, Harry, but when you were born, James and Lily
    made me your guardian... 
 I know. 
 And, well, I'll understand if you choose to stay with your aunt and
    uncle, but, so you know, you could - 
 Come live with you? When! 
 Soon as my name's cleared... 
 Harry... 
 Remus, old friend... did you take your potion tonight? 
 Run. All of you. Now. 
 You know the man you truly are, Remus. This flesh is only flesh.
     
 This heart is where you truly live. This heart! Here!
     
 No! 
 Expelliarmus! 
 Professor...? 
 Out of the way! 
 Sirius! 
 Harry! 
 NO!!! 
 Please, Professor. Stop... It's me. 
 Sirius! 
 Sirius! 
 No... No! 
 Expecto... Patronum! 
 Expecto... Patronum... 
 Harry - 
 I saw my dad. 
 What...? 
 He sent the Dementors away... I saw him. Across the lake... 
 Listen, Harry. They've captured Sirius. Any minute the Dementors are going
    to perform the Kiss. 
 The Kiss...? 
 It's what Dementors do to those they want to destroy. They clamp their jaws
    over the victim's mouth and... suck out his soul. 
 You mean, they're going to kill Sirius? 
 No. It's worse. Much worse. You go on living. But you have no memory. No
    sense of self. You're just a shall. An empty shell... 
 Headmaster! You've got to stop them! They've got the wrong man! 
 It's true, sir. Sirius is innocent - 
 It's Scabbers who did it! 
 Scabbers...? 
 My rat, sir. Only he's not really a rat. Well, he was a rat. You see, he used to
    be my brother Percy's - 
 The point is... we know the truth. Please, sir, you must believe us. 
 I do, Miss Granger. But I'm sorry to say the word of three thirteen
    year-old wizards will convince few others. A child's voice, however honest and true, is
    meaningless to those who have forgotten how to listen. 
 Ah... a shooting star. If ever one was to make a wish, now would be the
    time. But time, I'm afraid, is precisely our problem... 
 Mysterious thing, time. Powerful. And, when meddled with... dangerous.
    Sirius Black is in the topmost cell of the Dark Tower. 
 You know the
    laws, Miss Granger. You must not be seen. And you would, I feel, do well to return before this
    last chime. If not... well, the consequences are really too ghastly to discuss. Three turns
    should do it, I think. If you succeed, more than one innocent life may be spared tonight.
     
 By the way, when in doubt, I find retracing my steps to be a wise place to
    begin... Good luck. 
 What in bloody hell was all that about? 
 Sorry, Ron. But seeing as you can't walk... 
 What just happened? Where's Ron? 
 Seven-thirty. Where were we at seven-thirty? 
 Huh? Dunno... going to Hagrid's? 
 Come on! We can't be seen! 
 Hermione! Will you please tell me what it is we're doing?! 
 But that... that's... us. This is not... normal. 
 This is a Time-Turner, Harry. McGonagall gave it to me first term. This is
    how I've been getting to my lessons all year. 
 You mean, we've gone back in time? 
 Yes. Dumbledore wanted us to return to this moment. Clearly something
    happened he wants us to change. 

    
 Good punch. Hurry! 
 Malfoy's coming!
 Not a word of this to anyone, understood! I'll get that
    jumped- up Mudblood one of these days. Mark my words... 
 Buckbeak's still alive. 
 Of course! Remember what Dumbledore said. If we succeed, more than one
    innocent life could be spared. 
 Buckbeak? But... how will saving Buckbeak help Sirius? 
 We'll see. 
 What? 
 Nothing. 
 Here they come. I better hurry. 
 No! Fudge has to see Buckbeak before we steal him. Otherwise, he'll think
    Hagrid set him free! 
 That's Pettigrew -
 No, Harry! You can't! 
 Hermione, that's the man who betrayed my parents! You don't expect me to just
    sit here... 
 Yes! You Must! 
 Harry, you're in Hagrid's
    hut right now. If you go bursting inside, you'll think you've gone mad. Awful things can happen
    when wizards meddle with time. We can't be seen. 
 Fudge is coming and... we're not leaving... why aren't we leaving? 
 Are you mad? 
 That hurt. 
 Sorry. 
 C'mon. Any minute now we're going to be coming out the back door. 
 Is that really what my hair looks like from the back? 
 Shhh! 
 Nothing, I just thought I saw... Never mind. 
 Now, Harry! 
 'It is the decision of the Committee for the
    Disposal of Dangerous Creatures that the Hippogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the condemned,
    shall be executed this day at sundown...' 
 Get away! 
 'The Committee's appointed executioner shall
    dispatch the condemned by means of beheading...' 
 C'mon, Buckbeak. Come on... 
 'As witnessed below.' You sign here, Hagrid. Very
    well, gentlemen. Let's step outside, shall we... 
 Excuse me, Minister. I believe I must sign as well...
     
 Here, Beaky... Come and get the nice dead ferret... yum yum... 
 Professor Dippet had those blackberries planted when he was Headmaster...
     
 Let's get this over with, shall we? 
 But... where is it? I just saw the beast not moments ago -- Hagrid? 
 Beaky... 

    
 How extraordinary! 
 Come now, Dumbledore. Someone's obviously released him. 
 Professor, I swear! I didn't! 
 I'm quite sure the Minister isn't suggesting that you had anything to do
    with it, Hagrid. How could you? You've been with us all along. 
 We should search the grounds - 
 Search the skies if you must, Minister. In the meantime, I wouldn't say no
    to a cup of tea, Hagrid. Or... a large brandy. 
 It seems your
    services will no longer be required. 
 Now what? 
 We save Sirius. 
 And we do that... how? 
 No idea. 
 Look. It's Lupin. 
 Here comes Snape. 
 And now we wait. 
 Now we wait. 
 'Least someone's enjoying himself. 
 Hermione... 
 Yes? 
 Before. Down by the lake. When I was with Sirius... I did see someone... that
    someone made the Dementors go away... 
 With a Patronus. I heard Snape telling Dumbledore when we were taken to the
    hospital. According to him, only a really powerful wizard could have conjured it. 
 It was my Dad. 
 It was my Dad who conjured the Patronus. 
 But, Harry, your Dad's... 
 Dead. I know. I'm just telling you what I saw. 
 
 You see Sirius talking to me? He's asking me to come live with him. 
 Really? 
 When we free him, I'll never have to go back to the Dursley's. I'm going to
    tell him I'd like to live someplace in the country. I think he'd like that, after all those
    years in Azkaban. We don't need a big place and I can help him... 
 It's happened. Lupin's transformed. 
 Which means Pettigrew is slipping safely into the night. While we just stand
    here... 
 OWWWWWWWWW!
 What are you doing? 
 Saving your life. 
 OWWWWWWWW! 

   
 Thanks. But we have to move. 
 Why? 
 Because that werewolf you just called is running right this way. 
 We've got to find him. 
 Poor Professor Lupin is having a really tough night... 
 Let's go. 
 This is horrible... 
 Don't worry. My Dad will come... Right there... you'll see... he'll come... any
    minute... he'll conjure the Patronus 
 No one's coming, Harry... HE WILL! 
 He will come! 
 No one's coming! You're dying, both of you... and no one's coming! 
 HARRY, NO! 
 EXPECTO PATRONUM! 
 You were right, Hermione. It wasn't my dad I saw earlier. It was... me. I saw
    myself conjuring the Patronus before. I knew I could do it this time, because... because I'd
    already done it. Does that make sense? 
 No. 
 But I don't like this! 
 Out of the way! 
 Alohomora! 
 Didn't really expect that to work. 
 Dunamis! Liberare! Annihilare! Emancipare! No. No. No. No. 
 You might try - 
 Quiet! I'm trying to think. 
 BOMBARDA! 
 That'll do. 
 You truly are your father's son, Harry! 
 I'll be forever grateful for this. To both of you. 
 I want to go with you. 
 One day perhaps. For some time... life will be too... unpredictable.
    Besides, you're meant to be here. 
 But promise me something, Harry. 
 Anything. 
 Trust yourself. No matter the challenges you face -- and I fear they
    will be many -- you'll be surprised how many times you can find the answers... 
 ...here. 
 A shooting star. Make a wish. 
 We have to go. 
 By the way, when in doubt, I always find retracing my steps to be a wise
    place to begin... Good luck. 
 Well? 
 He's free -- Sirius. We... we did it. 
 Did what? 
 How'd you two get over there? I was just talking to you... over there. 
 What d'you think, Harry? Too much for him -- everything that's happened
    tonight? 
 Afraid so. Always been a bit of the nervous type, Ron has. 
 Hello, Harry. 
 Saw you coming. 
 I've looked worse, believe me. 
 You've been sacked. 
 Resigned, actually. 
 Resigned! But why! 
 It seems that someone has let slip the nature of my condition. 
 Snape. 
 Whoever. It was bound to get out. This time tomorrow, the owls will
    start arriving. Parents will not want a --someone like me - teaching their children. 
 But Dumbledore - 
 Has already risked enough on my behalf. Besides, people like me,
    well... let's just say I'm used to this by now. But before I go, tell me about your Patronus. 
 Well. At first I thought it was a horse, or perhaps a unicorn, but I think it
    was - 
 A stag. 
 Yes. 
 Your father used to transform into one. That's how he was able to
    keep me company when I became... sick. He was a great friend James. 
 There are stories about him and your mother, you know. Some are even
    true. But I think it's safe to say in the end, you'll know them best by getting to know
    yourself. 
 Mischief managed. 
 Stand back, I said! I'll take it upstairs if you don't settle! 
 Harry! Wherever did you get it! 
 Can I have a go, Harry? After you, of course - 
 Quiet! 
 Thank you. Let the man through. 
 Whose is that? 

    
 Whose is it? It's yours, mate. 
 But... how? Who? 
 It's a mystery. Though... this fell out of the wrapping. 
 That's a Hippogriff feather -
 Go on, Harry. 
 Yeah. Let's see. 

   
 What's wrong? 
 I don't think it works. I think it's defective. 

   
 Oh, come on now. It's just a broom. 

    

   
 The fastest broom in the world.
