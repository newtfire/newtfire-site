      <description>The episode opens to Team Avatar's place of stay in Ba Sing Se, where Sokka
                is drawing inaccurate pictures of Appa for missing posters. Katara and Aang
                enter.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cheerfully.</charAction> We found a printer to make our posters!
                <charAction>Reveals the poster and Aang smiles and points at
            it.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day
            on my Appa! <charAction>Shows his crudely drawn picture of Appa with a proud smile. Cut
                to an exasperated Aang while Katara tries to hold back her
            laughter.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Sokka, the arrow is on Appa's head.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Dismayed.</charAction> This is his head. <charAction>Points to the
                sketch.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Takes the picture from Sokka, looks confused.</charAction> Why are feet
            coming out of it?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Snatches back the picture indignantly.</charAction> Those are his horns.
                <charAction>Hangs his head.</charAction> I haven't seen him in a while,
            okay?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Mockingly.</charAction> It looks just like him to me!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Thank you, I worked really- <charAction>Suddenly remembering that she is
                blind.</charAction> Why do you feel the need to do that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Let's just stick with the professional version.</speech>

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang and Momo dropping dozens of posters all over Ba Sing Se. One
                poster falls in front of the camera, and the scene changes to tea shop where Zuko
                and Iroh are working. Iroh serves tea to two customers, who enjoy it. They approach
                him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Quon">So, you're the genius behind this incredible brew. The whole city is buzzing about
            you! I hope Pao pays you well.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Good tea is its own reward.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Quon">But it doesn't have to be the only reward. How would you
            like to have your own tea shop?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Frontal view. Pao looks around, concerned.</charAction> My own tea shop?
            This is a dream come true!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pao">
         <charAction>Quickly moving to stand between the group.</charAction> What's going on
            here? Are you trying to poach my tea-maker?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Quon">Sorry Pao, but that's business for you, am I right?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pao">Mushi, if you stay, I'll make you assistant manager. Wait, senior assistant
            manager!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Quon">I'll provide you with a new apartment in the Upper Ring. <charAction>Cut to Zuko,
                who was busy putting empty tea cups on a tray, but now looks up and glances over his
                shoulder to follow Quon's offer more closely; voice-over.</charAction> The tea shop
            is yours to do whatever you want, <charAction>Cut back to frontal shot of
                Quon.</charAction> complete creative freedom.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">I even get to name the shop?</speech>

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pao">Uh, senior executive assistant manager?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Iroh hands him the pot of tea and bows to the customer, agreeing to the
                terms. Zuko walks by, as Pao walks away sadly.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Did you hear, nephew? This man wants to give us our own tea shop in the Upper Ring
            of the city!</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Quon">That's right, young man, your life is about to change for the better!</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> I'll try to contain my joy.
                <charAction>Walks outside, slams door shut.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As he walks outside, he grabs a falling Appa poster. He climbs to the top
                of a house and notices several of them falling, searching the skies for any sign of
                the Avatar. He glances down again at the Appa poster. Camera zooms in as he looks up
                from the poster with a determined look on his face.</description>
      <description>Back at the house. Sokka and Katara are playing a game. Toph is just
                relaxing as Aang re-enters.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I just finished dropping all the leaflets. Has anyone come in with news about
            Appa?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">It's only been a day. Just be patient. <charAction>Aang sits,
                unenthused.</charAction> </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A knock at the door and Aang jumps up and runs to the door.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Wow, you're right! Patience really pays off! <charAction>Opens the door, revealing
                the "original" Joo Dee has returned.</charAction> Joo Dee?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">Hello, Aang, and Katara, and Sokka, and Toph.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>They approach as Joo Dee enters.</charAction> What happened to you? Did
            the Dai Li throw you in jail?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">What? Jail? Of course not. The Dai Li are the protectors of our cultural
            heritage.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">But you disappeared at the Earth King's party.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">Oh, I simply took a short vacation to Lake Laogai, out in the country. It was quite
            relaxing. <charAction>Sokka glares at her skeptically.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo
            Dee.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">
         <charAction>Surprised.</charAction> I'm Joo Dee.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Why are you here?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">Dropping fliers and putting up posters isn't permitted within the city. Not without
            proper clearance.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We can't wait around to get permission for everything.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">You are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up
            posters.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Angrily yelling; during this brief argument, Aang is shown as a chibi
                and his head turns scarlet red.</charAction> We don't care about the rules and we're
                not asking permission! <charAction>Camera cuts to Joo
                Dee's horrified face. She slowly backs out of the house as Aang continues to yell at
                her.</charAction> We're finding Appa on our own and you should just stay out of our
            way! <charAction>Slams the door as she exits.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That might come back to bite us in the blubber.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Calming down.</charAction> I don't care! From now on, we do whatever it
            takes to find Appa!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Yeah, let's break some rules! <charAction>Takes out a side of the house with
                earthbending.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Momo flies out the broken side of the house and they all exit. Two Dai Li
                agents watch overhead from a house roof across the street. </description>
      <description>The scene changes to the Royal Palace, where Long Feng meets with that
                particular Joo Dee. Two Dai Li agents stand guard.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">I'm very disappointed in your work with the Avatar and his friends, Joo Dee. I had
            hoped that you would be able to control this situation.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">I am so sorry, but they don't trust me anymore. <charAction>Starts getting
                upset.</charAction> I don't think I can keep working like this! <charAction>Begins
                to sob.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">Joo Dee, the Earth King has invited you to Lake Laogai.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Joo Dee">
         <charAction>Camera zooms toward her eye as its iris dilates; in a monotone
                voice.</charAction> I am honored to accept his invitation.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">
         <charAction>Nods.</charAction> Good. Now go await further orders. <charAction>Joo
                Dee nods and begins to exit. Long Feng gets up and moves to the
                fireplace.</charAction> If the Avatar keeps searching for his bison, it could upset
            the delicate balance we've worked so hard to achieve in this city. It could even cost us
            control of the Earth King.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Dai Li agent">Should we take care of him?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Long Feng">No. It's much too dangerous for us to confront him directly. Let's see if we can
            still handle this quietly.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>At Iroh and Zuko's place of stay, which is about to change. Zuko enters
                Iroh's room. Iroh is packing his clothes.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">So, I was thinking about names for my new tea shop. How about the Jasmine Dragon?
            It's dramatic, poetic, has a nice ring to it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Shows Iroh the flyer.</charAction> The Avatar is here in Ba Sing Se and
            he's lost his bison.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Grabs the flyer.</charAction> We have a chance for a new life here.
                <charAction>Cut to Zuko looking out a window.</charAction> If you start stirring up
            trouble, we could lose all the good things that are happening for us.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Turns to Iroh.</charAction> Good things that are happening for
                you! Have you ever thought that I want more from life
            than a nice apartment and a job serving tea?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">There is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity. I suggest you think
            about what it is that you want from your life and why.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I want my destiny.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">What that means is up to you. <charAction>Zuko walks away. Continues brainstorming
                names for his new tea shop.</charAction> The Tea Weevil! No, that's stupid.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut back to Team Avatar, who are working to put up more
                posters.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with
            me.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Peevishly.</charAction> Why? Because you think I can't put up posters on
            my own?! <charAction>Angrily takes the paintbrush of glue from Sokka and throws glue on
                the wall. She slams a poster on it, but it is backward. Awkward pause.</charAction>
            It's upside-down, isn't it? I'll just go with Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They all go their separate ways, with Toph following Sokka. Cut to an open
                square, where Katara is putting up a poster on a stone plinth near a flowing water
                stream. Suddenly, behind her, she hears a familiar voice call out.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Katara?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Jet is seen emerging from an alleyway at the edge of the square. Katara
                wheels around with a startled gasp.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">
         <charAction>Walks closer. Smiling confidently.</charAction> I think I can help you.
                <charAction>Katara's shocked blush transforms into a look of pure outrage. With a
                sweep of her arms, she bends up water from a lake directly at him while screaming in
                rage. Jet looks at the wave in fright.</charAction> Katara, I've changed!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The wave hits Jet, sending him back quite a distance.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Bending up remaining water from the wave.</charAction> Tell it to some
            other girl, Jet! <charAction>Turns the water to ice, which sends Jet back to a
                wall.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">
         <charAction>Blocks the ice with his swords.</charAction> I don't want to fight you,
            I'm here to help!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Throws his swords down, and reaches for something behind his back. Katara
                quickly fires more ice crystals, which pin him to the wall. The rest of the team
                approaches.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Katara, what is it?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Jet's back. <charAction>Close-up of Jet's face. Cut to aerial view before switching
                to a closer view of the group.</charAction> We can't trust anything Jet
            says.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">But we don't even know why he's here!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">I'm here to help you find Appa! <charAction>Opens his hand and reveals he is holding
                a missing Appa poster.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Turning from the leaflet back to Katara.</charAction> Katara, we have to
            give him a chance.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">I swear, I've changed! I was a troubled person and I let my anger get out of
            control, but I don't even have the gang now! I've put all that behind me!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">You're lying!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Walks up to Jet and feels the wall he is pinned to.</charAction> He's
            not lying.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">How can you tell?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I can feel his breathing and heartbeat. When people lie, there's a physical
            reaction. He's telling the truth.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Katara, we don't have any leads. If Jet says he can take us to Appa, we have to
            check it out.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">All right. <charAction>Points and looks angrily at Jet.</charAction> But we're not
            letting you out of our sight.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She stabs her finger at Jet once more for emphasis, eyes narrowed. Cut to
                Jet entering a dimly lit warehouse, which sits empty except for a few sacks and a
                pile of canvas and rope.</description>

                agents with his swords, and trips another. A full battle ensues. Aang deals with a
                pair of Dai Li agents. Sokka and Katara destroy two Dai Li gloves, but a second pair
                grabs them.</description>
      <description>Toph saves them by creating a rock wall and she raises ground up. Toph

                gather around Jet. Katara stares open-mouthed at Jet, her hands hovering near her
                mouth in shock. Snapping out of it, she withdraws water from her water skin, with
                which she covers her hands, and it begins to glow as she kneels down next to him.
                Cut to a shot from over her shoulder, with Jet glancing at her while she rubs her
                hands over his chest in an attempt to heal him. After rubbing his chest three times,
                the glow fades, the water stains Jet's clothing, and Katara looks back over her

      <description>Appa closes his eyes. A teary-eyed Katara somberly looks over Lake Laogai
