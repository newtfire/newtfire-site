      <description>The episode opens to a body of water, a small ferry cruising through the
                ocean. The head of a large sea lion emerges from the water and the creature is shown
                to be pulling the boat. As the camera pans out, we see Azula, who is leaning her
                back against a railing with her arms crossed, and Ty Lee, who is looking out in
                front of them.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">

         <charAction>Frontal view.</charAction> Well, yes, I guess you're right. I don't have
            sob stories like all of you. I could sit here and complain how our mom liked Zuko more

                pans up to show Ty Lee on a support beam. She flip off the beam and flies forward.
                Cut to a wide side-view of the room as she grab on to a chandelier, jumping on to
                another before it falls. She jumps off screen and the second one falls too. Cut to a
                close-up of Chan, in tears and with mucus draining from his nose, as Azula smiles
                behind him. Fade to a painted picture of the foursome smiling, arms around each
                other, with a roaring fire in the background.</description>
