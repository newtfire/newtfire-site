      <description>The episode opens where several Fire Nation tanks rumble across the
                terrain, a large metal mechanism following close behind. The camera zooms out to a
                shot of the Fire Nation drill slowly moving its way toward the Outer Wall of Ba Sing
                Se. Several sections of the drill extend forward, releasing steam as spikes are
                driven into the ground. The drill's command module ascends where inside are Princess
                Azula, her friends, Mai and Ty Lee, War Minister Qin and several operators of the
                drill.</description>

      <speech speaker="Qin">This drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power. Once it
            tunnels through the wall, our troops will storm their city. The Earth Kingdom will
            finally fall, and you can claim Ba Sing Se in the name of your father. Nothing can stop
            us.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Ty Lee">
         <charAction>Looking through the telescope.</charAction> Hmmm, what about those
            muscle-y guys down there?</speech>

      <description>She peers through a periscope at several Earth Kingdom troops using
                earthbending to create large trenches, Fire Nation forces following them in hot
                pursuit.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Qin">
         <charAction>Strikes the periscope roughly alarming Ty Lee.</charAction> Please. The
            drill's metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">Oh, I'm sure it is, War Minister Qin, but just to be on the safe side ...
                <charAction>Sharply while looking at the two girls.</charAction> Mai and Ty Lee,
            take the earthbenders out!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Mai">
         <charAction>Swinging a knife around her finger; relieved.</charAction> Finally,
            something to do. <charAction>Rises and walks out.</charAction>

      <description>The scene changes to where Katara, Sokka and Toph are escorting Than and
                his family to the city. Aang appears, flying in on his glider with Momo behind him.
                He lands, Momo perched on his shoulder.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Surprised.</charAction> Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you
            were looking for Appa.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I was, but something stopped me. Something big.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene switches to the base of the Outer Wall where Aang and Toph use
                earthbending to transport everyone up the wall.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Now what's so big that Appa has to wait?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Ying">
         <charAction>Despairingly.</charAction> We made it to Ba Sing Se and we're still not

      <speech speaker="Aang">I'm the Avatar. Take me to whoever is in charge.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to a portion of the Outer Wall where a roof rises
                overhead, supported by tall arches. An Earth Kingdom general sits behind a
                desk.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="General Sung">
         <charAction>Happily.</charAction> It is an honor to welcome you to the Outer Wall,
            young Avatar, but your help is not needed.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Not needed?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="General Sung">
         <charAction>Calmly.</charAction>
            Not needed. I have the situation under control. I assure you
            the Fire Nation cannot penetrate this wall. Many have tried to break through it, but
            none have succeeded.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">What about the Dragon of the West? He got in.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="General Sung">
         <charAction>Slightly taken aback.</charAction> Well ... uh, technically yes, but he
            was quickly expunged. <charAction>Confidently.</charAction> Nevertheless, that is why
            the city is named Ba Sing Se. It's the "impenetrable city". They don't call it Na Sing
            Se. <charAction>Laughs, but subsequently turns serious.</charAction> That means
            "penetrable city."</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Yeah, thanks for the tour, but we still got the drill problem.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="General Sung">Not for long. To stop it, I've sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the
            Terra Team.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That's a good group name. Very catchy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene cuts to where the Terra Team is launching their assault on the
                Fire Nation drill. They manage to overthrow one tank and get closer to the
                drill.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Terra Team leader">Ready ... attack!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The earthbenders wedge large earth spikes into the metal shell of the drill
                to halt it. However, the drill's segments separate, reducing the columns to
                crumbles. The Terra Team narrowly manages to conjure earth shields to defend
                themselves against an assault of flying daggers hurled by Mai. She and Ty Lee are
                seen sliding down the shell of the drill. The scene cuts to the side of the drill
                where Ty Lee lands gracefully onto the ground. She effortlessly manages to defeat
                the earthbenders through an acrobatic display, utilizing chi blocking.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Complaining.</charAction> So I'm the only one who can ever come up with

      <description>Camera changes to view of Jet, overlooking Zuko, now under the adopted
                alias, Lee.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">I think Lee would make a good Freedom Fighter. He's just trying to find his way in

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">We are, and the new Freedom Fighters could use a guy like Lee. What do you think,
            Longshot?</speech>

      <description>Longshot looks over at him silently with a meaningful look on his face and

      <description>Meanwhile, back at the Outer Wall, Katara attempts to heal a member of the

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Terra Team member">Two girls ambushed us. One of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly I
            couldn't earthbend anymore and I could barely move. Then she cartwheeled away.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Eyes widen in realization.</charAction> Ty Lee. She doesn't look
            dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you
            down from the inside.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty

            take it down from the inside.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene cuts to the Fire Nation drill. The camera pans to where Aang,
                Katara, Sokka and Toph are crouching together in one of the abandoned trenches of
                the Terra Team.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Gesturing toward the drill.</charAction> Once I whip up some cover,
            you're not going to be able to see. So, stay close to me.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She steps outside the trench and with a powerful stomp of her foot, sending
                a mass of flying debris clouding toward the drill.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Run!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The group races into the dust cloud behind Toph. The scene cuts to the
                command module where Ty Lee is peering at the cloud through the
                periscope.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ty Lee">Hey, look at that dust cloud. <charAction>Periscope view shows front of drill and
                billowing cloud.</charAction> It's so ... poofy. <charAction>Cut back to Ty Lee who
                looks away from the periscope with a spaced-out expression.</charAction>
            Poof.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Qin">Don't worry, Princess. I'm sure it's nothing. <charAction>Azula casts a doubtful
                look.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to outside where the group is standing in the midst of
                the dust beside the drill. Toph earthbends a hole into the ground.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Everyone into the hole!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She and the others jump into the hole and the ground above them closes
                shut. The camera pans to underground where it is pitch black.</description>

         <charAction>Sheepishly.</charAction> Sorry.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They make their way to the surface underneath the drill, where Sokka spots
                an opening.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">There!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang leaps up to the bar hanging from the opening and, dangling upside-down
                from his legs, hoists himself and Katara into the drill. He realizes Toph is not
                following them. Sokka sticks his head out of the drill.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Toph, come on!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">No way am I going in that metal monster. I can't bend in there. I'll try to slow it

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Okay, good luck! <charAction>He and Aang disappear into the
            drill.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph earthbends a wedge of rock into the drill, however, it is proving to
                be a difficult task as it pushes her back. The scene changes to inside the drill
                where Sokka is leading the others through a tunnel of valves and
                pipes.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like.
            Then we can find its weak points.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Where are we going to get something like that? <charAction>Sokka unexpectedly cuts
                off a steam valve with his machete.</charAction> What are you doing? Someone's going
            to hear us!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when
            something breaks ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">They come to fix it!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang and Katara smile at each other. Moments later, an engineer wearing a
                mask is seen walking down the misty hallway to the site of the damage.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Appears behind him.</charAction> Hi.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>She freezes the mist, covering the engineer in a thin layer of ice. Sokka
                runs up to the frozen engineer and takes his schematics.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">This'll work. Thanks!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The trio runs off, leaving the helpless engineer who drops his spear
                unintentionally. The scene changes to where Sokka and the others are studying the
                plans.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner
            mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are
            connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will
            collapse.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang and Katara nod in agreement. The scene changes to the train station
                where Zuko, Iroh and the three Freedom Fighters are awaiting their train. The camera
                focuses on Zuko and Iroh, who sit in the waiting area. Jet approaches and sits next
                to Zuko.</description>

      <speech speaker="Jet">So, you guys got plans once you're inside the city?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Waves hand.</charAction> Ooh! Jasmine please.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The tea seller pours tea into a leaf cup for Iroh. Iroh sips the tea, but
                soon grimaces at its repulsive taste.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Blaugh! Ugh, coldest tea in Ba Sing Se is more like it! What a disgrace!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Hey, can I talk to you for a second?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He motions for Zuko to follow him. Zuko sighs and reluctantly rises. The
                two walk several feet away from Iroh's spot.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">You and I have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together.
            You want to join the Freedom Fighters?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Thanks, but I don't think you want me in your gang.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Come on, we made a great team looting that captain's food. Think of all the good we
            could do for these refugees.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Walking away.</charAction> I said no.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jet">Have it your way.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He catches sight of Iroh, who is sipping his now steaming hot tea, causing
                his eyes to widen in shock and realization. Zuko, approaching Iroh, glances over his
                shoulder at Jet, who narrows his eyes and walks away. Angrily, he knocks the tea cup
                out of Iroh's hand.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">Hey!</speech>

      <description>Katara and Aang shoot each other awkward looks. The scene cuts to one where
                the two are positioned on either side of one brace. Using waterbending, they slice
                through the metal sharply. The shot changes to when the brace is sliced halfway
                through. Both Katara and Aang are bent over and gasping in exhaustion.</description>

      <description>The two resume work slicing the brace. With every lash of the water whip,

                dismay. The camera cuts to a scene of the drill hammering through the wall, sending
                loose boulders in every direction. The scene changes to one of a stream of a
                saturated rock and water solution traveling through tubes and making its way through

                slide through the slurry onto the ground with Ty Lee following them in hot pursuit.
                Katara uses waterbending to stop the flow of slurry and plug up the back entrance of

      <description>Azula appears before the Avatar and a battle ensues between the two. Azula
                shoots fire blasts at Aang, who manages to block them using airbending. She
                continues the fire attacks only to have each one of her strikes deterred by water
                whips. She eventually manages to vaporize the water, sending Aang back. The two
                narrowly dodge the several boulders that are hurtled toward them at that moment.
                Aang uses earthbending and airbending to send rocks at Azula, who manages to avoid
                them all. Azula sends another powerful firebending assault that slams Aang into the
                Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se, leaving him unconscious.</description>
      <description>The camera view briefly changes to where the front of the drill is seen
                having completely dug its way through the Outer Wall. Camera changes to Azula as she
                walks over to him with fire in her right hand, preparing to deal a deadly final
                strike, but Aang awakens and sends her skidding back using an earthbending gauntlet.
                A flood of slurry is released as the drill bores deeper into the wall, coating the
                two. Azula slides toward a helpless Aang, attempting to halt herself by windmilling
                only to collide with him. The force of the collision sends both sliding off opposite
                sides of the drill. Azula is able to stop her descent by grinding her feet into the
                drill's side while Momo drags Aang up to the top with the help of Aang's
                airbending.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Thanks, Momo. I owe you one. <charAction>Runs over to the wedge he sliced in the
                drill.</charAction> Now all I need ... <charAction>A boulder falls before
                him.</charAction> Actually, that is what I need for once.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He uses airbending to position the boulder over the X mark in the drill.
                Using earthbending, he cuts the rock several times, creating a wedge that fits
                inside the middle of the hole. He begins sprinting toward the wall, scales up its
                side by riding an air scooter and, once he arrives at his highest point, rockets at
                lightning speed toward the bottom. As he propels himself downward, Azula catches
                sight of him and fires at him. She misses by mere seconds and is sent back
                forcefully as Aang leaps and slams down on the wedge, creating a large ripple
                effect. The impact of the blow causes the sliced braces inside the drill to collapse
                and the pipes to burst, releasing a torrent of slurry. Slurry begins to seep from
                the drill. The scene cuts to Katara and Toph, who remain in their bending
                stances.</description>

   <section>
      <description>She earthbends Katara, Sokka, and herself onto a rock pillar to avoid the
                flood of slurry. Slurry gushes from the rear of the drill, and Ty Lee slams into the
                wall of the rock pillar as she is forcefully pushed forward by the flood. The drill
                begins to release steam and its segments begin to collapse. On the other side of the
                wall, the drill is seen coming to a halt.</description>
      <description>The camera zooms out on the destroyed drill. The scene cuts to Aang covered
                in slurry, Momo licking him as he wipes it away near his face, a huge smile spread
                across his face. Cut to War Minister Qin, who stares at the slurry from inside the
                command module, completely shocked. Cuts to General Sung atop the Outer Wall,
                covered in the muck. Cuts to Ty Lee as she attempts to clear away the mess. Cut to
                shot of Azula, skidding down the drill also covered in slurry. She lands by Ty Lee,
                causing the acrobat to be covered in slurry once again. A hatch opens, revealing
                Mai, who is completely clean.</description>

                earthbenders begin moving the train out of the station. Scene changes to Team Avatar
                standing at the top of the wall, overlooking the sunset.</description>
