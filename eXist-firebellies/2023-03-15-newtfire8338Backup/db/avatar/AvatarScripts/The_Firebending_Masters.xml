      <description>The episode opens with a shot of the sky from the Western Air Temple, and
                the camera pans below to Zuko and Aang standing on the balcony of an upside down
                pagoda in the temple.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">I know you're nervous, but remember, firebending in it of itself is
                not something to fear.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cut to Aang, as he sighs heavily.</charAction> Okay. Not something to

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to Zuko from behind Aang.</charAction> But if you don't respect it,
                <charAction>He raises his voice, as the camera zooms to a close-up of his
                face.</charAction> it'll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo
            rhino!</speech>

      <description>Cut to Aang's face, as he yelps in fear, before cutting back to
                Zuko.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Now show me what you've got. Any amount of fire you can make.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Aang, as he inhales nervously and tries to firebend. Cut to a
                close-up of his palm, as a small cloud of smoke appears, and is dissipated. Camera
                pans left to Aang.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Maybe I need a little more instruction. Perhaps a demonstration?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to an aerial shot of the both.</charAction> Good idea. You might
            wanna take a couple steps back.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang walks back, and shot cuts to a close-up of Zuko's face, as he inhales
                deeply. Screen zooms back to show Zuko grunting, and cuts to his fist, which lets
                out a very small flame. Aang applauds at this display.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Takes a step back.</charAction> What was that? That was the worst
            firebending I've ever seen!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cut to Aang.</charAction> I thought it was ... nice. <charAction>Smiles
                slightly and shrugs.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko grunts again and tries firebending again, with all three attempts
                resulting in very small flames similar to the first. He grunts and looks at his
                palms.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Frustrated.</charAction> Why is this happening?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Rubbing his head, confused.</charAction> Maybe it's the
            altitude.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Turning back.</charAction> Yeah, could be.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to some pagodas and pans below to Aang sitting on a broken
                pillar and Zuko standing. Zuko attempts firebending, which results in a similar
                small flame again. He grunts and delivers another similar blast, as Aang yawns and
                lies down on the pillar.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Just breathe, and ... <charAction>He delivers another blast with no
                improvement.</charAction>
      </speech>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Very angry.</charAction> Don't patronize me! You know what it's supposed

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Raises his arms to his head, and throws them down back, and shouts in
                frustration, as Aang cringes.</charAction> And stop calling me that!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Shot cuts to Sokka walking toward the teacher and his pupil, eating an
                apple. Sokka sits down near the two, as they turn their heads toward
                him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Frustrated.</charAction> Get out of here! <charAction>He lashes his arm
                and points to a side.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Okay, take it easy. <charAction>He drops his half-eaten apple.</charAction> I was
            just kiddin' around. <charAction>He gets up and turns around, laughing as he adjusts his
                shirt.</charAction> Jerkbending, still got it. <charAction>Zuko drops his head,
                dejected, and moans.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to an aerial shot of Appa resting near a fountain at night,
                and zooms to show him eating a small bale of hay. Screen pans to the right to show
                Zuko leaning on a column with his arms crossed, looking below and thinking deeply.
                He turns his head to the campfire where everyone is settled for dinner, and walks
                toward them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Listen everybody, I've got some pretty bad news. I've lost my stuff. <charAction>He
                looks below dejectedly.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Raises both hands to her head.</charAction> Don't look at me,

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">I'm talking about my firebending. It's gone. <charAction>He looks below

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Sokka, Haru, The Duke, and Teo looking at him, as the former Freedom
                Fighter sits up. Camera pans left, as Katara laughs, and everyone's attention is
                focused on her. Zuko looks at the waterbender with an annoyed
                expression.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for
            us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Camera zooms back to show everyone sitting around the campfire and Zuko
                standing.</charAction> Well, it's not lost. It's just ... weaker for some
            reason.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Holding up her bowl and glaring at Zuko.</charAction> Maybe you're not
            as good as you think you are.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Screen pans left to Toph.</charAction> Ouch. <charAction>She smiles

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>With an idea.</charAction> I bet it's because I changed sides.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Still holding her bowl.</charAction> That's ridiculous. <charAction>She
                drinks from the bowl.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I don't know. Maybe it isn't. Maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just
            don't have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Leans toward Zuko and points a finger above.</charAction> Sooo, all we
            need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka pokes Zuko with his sword's hilt in the head and waist several times,
                laughing.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Okay, cut it out! <charAction>Sokka stops poking, as his sword slips from his hands
                and is thrown above, before falling on his head. Zuko rubs his nose.</charAction>
            Look, even if you're right, I don't want to rely on hate and anger anymore. There has to
            be another way.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Cut to Toph, as Sokka sits near her, and rubs his head.</charAction>
            You're gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source. I recommend
            the original source. <charAction>Eats the food from her bowl.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Excited.</charAction> How's he supposed to do thatâ€Œ? By jumping into a
            volcanoâ€Œ?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">No. Zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending
            is.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Seriously.â€‹</charAction> So, is it jumping into a volcano?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">I don't know. <charAction>Places her bowl down as the shot cuts to a close-up of her
                face.</charAction> For earthbending, the original benders were badgermoles.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to a cave in a flashback as a younger Toph wearing a gown is
                kneeling down, and crying, as screen zooms out.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Voice-over.</charAction> One day, when I was little, I ran away and hid
            in a cave.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to the younger Toph's face, as she is startled by a rumbling noise, and
                part of the cave's wall breaks. Shot cuts to behind Toph to show one of a
                badgermole's legs.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">That's where I met them.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph cringes in fear, and the badgermole comes into the screen near Toph
                and sniffs her. Toph sniffs back and the badgermole licks her cheek, causing her to
                giggle in delight. She touches the badgermole's snout with both hands before licking
                it, and giggles again.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">They were blind, just like me. <charAction>The badgermole walks away as Toph
                attempts to crawls after it.</charAction> So we understood each other. I was able to
            learn earthbending, <charAction>Cut to an overhead shot of the badgermole, which moves
                its paws in a sweeping motion.</charAction> not just as a martial art, but as an
            extension of my senses. <charAction>Screen fades to an overhead shot of Toph mimicking
                the creature's actions.</charAction> For them, the original earthbenders,
                <charAction>The badgermole comes across a pile of rocks and earthbends them to the
                side.</charAction> it wasn't just about fighting. It was their way of interacting
            with the world. <charAction>She stops crawling and stands up. She earthbends a stone and
                smiles at her success.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Screen fades from the younger Toph's face back to the present Toph's
                smiling face.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">That's amazing, Toph!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cut to an aerial shot of the group.</charAction> I learned from the
            monks, but the original airbenders were the sky bison. <charAction>Camera pans above to
                show a mural of three sky bison. Aang leans back to look at Appa.</charAction> Maybe
            you can give me a lesson sometime, buddy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa growls from the shed.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Well, this doesn't help me. The original firebenders were the dragons, and they're
            extinct.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Shot cuts to behind Zuko as he looks at the group.</charAction> What do
            you meanâ€Œ? Roku had a dragon, and there were plenty of dragons when I was a
            kid.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to Zuko's face, as he yells.</charAction> Well, they aren't around
            anymore, okay?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Okay, okay. <charAction>Moves his arms in an appeasing manner.</charAction> I'm
            sorry.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">But maybe there's another way. <charAction>He walks toward a fountain.</charAction>
            The first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient Sun Warriors.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Walks toward Zuko.</charAction> Sun Warriors? Well, I know they weren't
            around when I was a kid.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Turning his head toward Aang.</charAction> No, they died off thousands
            of years ago. But their civilization wasn't too far from where we are now.
                <charAction>Cut to a shot of the two from the side, as Zuko turns his head toward
                the Avatar.</charAction> Maybe we can learn something by poking around their
            ruins.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">It's like the monks used to tell me. Sometimes, the shadows of the past can be felt
            by the present.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">So, what? <charAction>Aang and Zuko look back at him and the shot cuts to Sokka
                seated.</charAction> Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by
            standing <charAction>Moves his hand in a strange motion.</charAction> where they stood a
            thousand years ago?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Cut to an aerial shot.</charAction> More or less. Either I find a new
            way to firebend, <charAction>Cut to a shot of the two from the side. Zuko turns his head
                toward Aang.</charAction> or the Avatar has to find a new teacher. <charAction>Aang
                looks concerned and worried at Zuko's statement.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to Aang and Zuko flying on Appa over an ocean. Cut to a bored
                Zuko.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">We've been riding for hours. I don't know why, but I thought this thing would be a
            lot faster.</speech>

      <description>Cut to Appa from below, as he growls.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Turning his head toward Zuko.</charAction> Appa's right, Zuko. In our
            group, typically we start our missions with a more up-beat attitude.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Whispering.</charAction> I can't believe this. <charAction>He lies

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">

            hang of it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Scene changes to an aerial shot of the ocean, as the screen pans above to
                an aerial shot of an island. Scene changes to an aerial shot of Appa descending to
                land on some ruins. The ruins make Aang and Zuko full of awe.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang and Zuko">Whoa!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Appa landing from the side. Shot cuts to show some mountains and
                pans below to an aerial shot of Aang and Zuko walking through the
                ruins.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Even though these buildings are ancient, there's something eerily familiar about
            them. <charAction>Cut to Aang and Zuko walking.</charAction> I can tell the Fire Sages'
            temples are somehow descended from these.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cut to some structures as screen pans right to show more of
                them.</charAction> Okay. We've learned something about architecture. <charAction>Cut
                back to the two walking.</charAction> Hopefully, we'll learn something about
            firebending too. The past can be a great teacher.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a tripwire, which is pulled when Aang walks by. He trips and yelps,
                as an overhead shot shows a small portion of the path in front of him going down and
                some spikes coming up from holes. Aang nearly falls on the spikes but blows a blast
                of air from his mouth which thrusts him up, and somersaults on to the other side, as
                he managed to regain balance.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Scared.</charAction> Zuko, I think the past is trying to kill

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Kneeling down to inspect the spikes.</charAction> I can't believe it.
                <charAction>He picks the tripwire up and examines it.</charAction> This booby trap
            must be centuries old and it still works.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">There's probably a lot more. Maybe this means we shouldn't be here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko takes two steps back and runs toward the wall adjoining the path. He
                runs on the wall before jumping on the other side of the spikes.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Dusting some dirt on his shirt.</charAction> Where's that up-beat
            attitude you were talkin' about? <charAction>He smiles, as Aang turns back. Cut to
                Zuko's point of view of the path as screen pans above to a building.</charAction>
            Besides, people don't make traps unless they've got something worth protecting.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Zuko and Aang coming onto the building from stairs.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Look, this seems promising. <charAction>Cut to Zuko and Aang from the behind, as
                they see a carving of a person being surrounded by two dragons who are breathing
