      <description>The episode begins in Aang's dream. The scene itself, dominated by a tinge
                of warm yellow, is filled with clouds for a moment before Aang slides into the frame
                of the shot, his face happy as he flicks the reins. The shot switches to a far view,
                showing that he is riding Appa, who is flapping his six legs in unison up and down
                as if he were a bird. The camera pans to the right, revealing Sokka as he pulls
                alongside Appa, using Aang's glider to fly with the Avatar. The shot cuts to a
                close-up of the Water Tribe warrior as he turns his head toward Aang, grinning
                broadly and contentedly at him. Cut to Aang as his face exhibits the same contented
                grin. He turns his attention to his right and the camera follows his gaze, revealing
                Katara sitting atop the head of an enormous Momo; she waves at Aang. Camera moves
                back to a wide frontal shot of the group coursing leisurely through the open
                sky.</description>

      <description>Aang notices something out of the corner of his eyes. As he turns toward
                it, his expression changes to shock. Focusing on Aang's face, the camera turns 180
                degrees and switches to his point of view as the sky's coloring changes to a dark,
                ominous gray, revealing a churning storm cloud before him. Cut back to Aang, who
                yanks Appa's reins in fright.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene rapidly zooms out, revealing that Aang and Appa are alone,
                surrounded by nothing but the darkening sky. Cut back to Aang's point of view as
                Gyatso, in lotus, floats downward, positioning himself in front of
                Aang.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a side-view of the two monks, not a meter apart from one another.
                Aang reaches out to Gyatso, but before he can touch him, Gyatso turns gray and
                dissipates into smoke; it blows over Aang, causing him to raise his left arm in
                front of his face and turn away to shield himself from it. Frontal shot of Aang as
                the last of the smoke washes over him. He peeks over his arm, but instantly raises
                his head, his eyes growing big in shock; a dark shadow passes over him as the shot
                cuts to a distant side-view of Appa being swallowed by the dark cloud.</description>

   <section>
      <description>A bolt of lightning splits the shot for an instant before cutting to a
                frontal shot of a screaming and frightened Aang, wrestling with the reins, as he and
                Appa are caught in the belly of the storm with rain beating down on them. Cut to an
                underwater shot as Aang and Appa plummet into the ocean. The duo floats for a
                moment. Cut to a close-up of Aang's hand as his grip on Appa's reins loosens and
                they slip from his limp grasp.</description>

      <speech speaker="Gyatso and Katara">
         <charAction>Echoing voice-over.</charAction> We need you, Aang. <charAction>Cut to a

            Aang. We need you.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Unmoving, Aang sinks and disappears into the darkness of the ocean. For a
                fraction of a second, lightning splits the shot once again and the silhouette of the
                Fire Lord surrounded by flames appears.</description>
      <description>The scene cuts to reality as Aang, gasping for air and shooting upright,
                startles Momo, who was curled up on top of Aang. Momo leaps onto Katara's stomach,
                causing her to shoot up with a startled look on her face, before jumping on Sokka's,
                who shoots up, still sleepy, halfheartedly wielding his dagger and
                boomerang.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka lies down, disappearing from view; Katara does the
                same.</description>
      <description>Scene changes to waves crashing on a sandy shore under a blue sky. Cut to a
                wide frontal shot of Katara as she carries their packs toward Appa, who yawns. As
                the animal closes its mouth again, Aang is revealed sitting on his head, while Sokka
                sits on the saddle.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Look at those clear skies, buddy! <charAction>Pets Appa's head. Cut to a close shot
                as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a "V" flying overhead, their
                goose-like honking audible.</charAction> Should be some smooth flying.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to an overhead shot looking down of Katara looking into a bag before
                holding it upside down, sprinkling the ground with crumbs; Momo instantly eats them.
                Sokka walks past her toward Appa, carrying some of their luggage.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Side-shot as he suddenly straightens up, his tone serious.</charAction>
            Guys, wait. This was in my dream. <charAction>Momo lands on the pack behind
                him.</charAction> We shouldn't go to the market.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Shot cuts beside Sokka, facing out toward Katara and Aang, who turn to
                look at him; curious.</charAction> What happened in your dream?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Frontal shot; his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in
                on him, rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs
                the scene.</charAction> Food eats people! <charAction>The colors return to normal as
                the shot cuts to Katara's face as she shakes her head. Behind her, Aang goes back to
                adjusting the reins. Cut to Sokka again as he points at Momo.</charAction> Also,
            Momo could talk. <charAction>He glares at Momo while crossing his arms.</charAction> You
            said some very unkind things.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Momo's ears droop as Sokka speaks. Cut to downward looking shot of a flock
                of birds in V-formation flying over the open ocean. As the scene pans to the left,
                Zuko's ship sails into view. Cut to the deck, where Iroh stands on the deck, with
                Zuko looking through a spyglass behind him. As the flight of birds passes over
                Iroh's head in the distance, he sniffs the air and Zuko lowers the spyglass to turn
                to his uncle, who speaks.</description>

      <description>The shot cuts behind the two, facing the prow of the ship and showing a

      <speech speaker="Iroh">A storm is approaching from the north. <charAction>He turns to face

   <section>
      <description>Behind them, Lieutenant Jee walks onto deck, inadvertently overhearing the
                conversation. As Zuko realizes Jee is behind him and turns to face him, his
                expression briefly loses its raging intensity. A quick close-up shows Jee raising an
                eyebrow as Zuko walks over to him; another cut shifts the view to the lieutenant's
                side as Zuko, addressing Jee directly, struts up to him, dominantly looking him
                right in the eyes from a close distance as he finishes speaking.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">Finding the Avatar is far more important than any individual's safety.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As Zuko walks away, Jee glares after him. The shot switches, showing Zuko
                leaving the deck through the door at the base of the superstructure. Cut to a
                frontal shot of Jee, who looks slightly enraged as Iroh walks over to
                him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Reassuringly, a twinge of uncertainty in his voice, almost as if he does
                not fully believe what he is saying.</charAction> He doesn't mean that. He's just
            all worked up.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to a seaside hamlet built on the side of a cliff face,
                the roofs all teal-green; a collection of houses sits back from the waterfront,
                where a row of warehouses adjoins the docks. Among the several ships moored on the
                town's four piers is Appa, floating in the water by himself. Cut to Katara, who
                stands in front of a small merchants' stand, suspiciously eying a
                watermelon.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Merchant woman">
         <charAction>As the shot zooms out, the merchant moves around the stand where Katara
                stands. Sokka and Aang, staff in hand, stand beside them; the former is filling a
                basket with fruit.</charAction> Swishing means it's ripe! It's the ripe juices
            swishing around, eh?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Taking a step toward Katara.</charAction> I think it's true, Katara.

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>As the shot cuts to a frontal view of her, she puts the melon back on

   <section>
      <description>As Sokka walks past the merchant, she indignantly kicks him in the rear,
                drawing a cry of pain from Sokka. Cut to Sokka, Katara, and Aang on the docks. Sokka
                is rubbing where the lady kicked him and seems downcast.</description>

      <description>A fisherman and his wife are walking behind the gang. As Katara finishes,

      <description>The scene changes to Zuko's ship on the open ocean. As the shot pans right,
                a massive bank of darkening clouds, having appeared seemingly out of nowhere, rolls
                into view, looming in front of the ship. Cut to the deck, where Lieutenant Jee and
                several other soldiers stand a short distance from the shot, staring at the clouds.
                Zuko walks into the foreground, regarding the clouds as Jee and the others turn to
                face him. Iroh walks between Zuko and Jee as the latter taunts the
                former.</description>

                from Jee, who follows Zuko with his eyes, continuing his taunting after a short

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jee">What do you know about respect? <charAction>Behind Jee, Iroh's expression turns to
                panic and he makes a cutting motion at his throat with his hand, trying to signal
                Lieutenant Jee to stop. Cut to Zuko's back as he stops walking before switching to
                his face as he listens to Jee's words.</charAction> The way you talk to everyone
            around here, from your hard-working crew to your esteemed uncle, shows you know nothing
            about respect! <charAction>Cut to a close-up of Iroh's face as he gasps slightly,
                reaching out a hand in desperation before moving it to his forehead in resignation,
                believing Jee has gone too far. Cut back to Zuko's face, contorted with
                rage.</charAction> You don't care about anyone but yourself! Then again, what should
            I expect from a spoiled prince?</speech>

                pulls theirs apart; the smoke fades.</charAction> Enough! We're all a bit tired from
            being at sea so long. I'm sure after a bowl of noodles, everyone will feel much

                ground.</charAction> Zuko had spoken out against the general's plan, but by doing so
            in the Fire Lord's war room, it was the Fire Lord whom he had disrespected.

      <speech speaker="Jee">I always thought that Prince Zuko was in a training accident.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Iroh">It was no accident. After the duel, the Fire Lord said that by refusing to fight,
            Zuko had shown shameful weakness. As punishment, he was banished and sent to capture the
            Avatar. Only then could he return with his honor.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Jee">So that's why he's so obsessed. Capturing the Avatar is the only chance he has of
            things returning to normal.</speech>
