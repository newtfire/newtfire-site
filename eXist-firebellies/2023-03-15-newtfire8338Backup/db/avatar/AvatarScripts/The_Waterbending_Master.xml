      <description>The episode opens to show a koala otter calmly floating on its back on the
                water, purring slightly. Noticing something approach to its right, it turns its
                head, chirps, and dives under water as a large shadow passes it by. It turns out to
                be Appa flying overhead.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Hanging lazily over the back of Appa's saddle; grumpily.</charAction>
            I'm not one to complain, <charAction>Side-view shows Appa flying just above the
                water.</charAction> but can't Appa fly any higher?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka's words barely left his lips as Appa loses more altitude and his paws
                drag through the water momentarily, before rising slightly again. Cut to a shot from
                Appa's saddle, showing a bored Katara popping herself up on her elbows, staring into
                nothingness in front of her, and a peeved Aang looking back from atop Appa's
                head.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Irritably.</charAction> I have an idea! Why don't we all get on your
                <charAction>Points angrily at Sokka; Katara briefly looks at Aang, but resumes her
                stare in front of her.</charAction> back and you could fly us to the North
            Pole?!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Back-view of Sokka looking over his shoulder;
                sarcastically.</charAction> I'd love to. <charAction>Points to his
                back.</charAction> Climb on everyone, <charAction>Shakes his rear.</charAction>
            Sokka's ready for take off.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A chirping Momo hops on his back, making Sokka shoot an angry glare at the
                animal. Cut back to the shot of Katara and Aang, with the latter still staring
                angrily at Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Waving her hands up and down while shifting looks between Aang and
                Sokka.</charAction> Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've
            been flying for two days straight.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Frontal shot, Momo is now on his lap; annoyed.</charAction> And for
            what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. <charAction>Cut to a wide side-shot,
                revealing Appa floating along a vast ocean of only water and ice.</charAction>
            There's nothing up here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Katara and Aang, with the former having laid down her head in
                boredom, letting it rest on her hands. She looks up in wonder when a slushing sound
                can be heard. Cut to a frontal shot of Appa, while the water in front of him
                suddenly rises and solidifies to ice spikes. Cut to a frontal shot of Aang screaming
                in fright, his eyes wide in horror, as he violently yanks the reins to this right in
                an attempt to avoid the sudden obstacle. Cut to a side-view of a growling and
                turning Appa. Cut to the siblings yelling in fright as they hold on for dear life to
                the sides of the saddle. Cut to a back-shot of a swerving Appa, who suddenly shoots
                up as another ice spike manifests right in from of him. A close-up shot of his
                underside shows that he was not quick enough, and part of the ice attaches itself to
                his leg, freezing instantly. His momentum causes the ice to break, but he is thrown
                off balance and catapulted away. Frontal shot of Katara and Sokka who loudly scream
                in fright. Cut to a wider shot of Appa spiraling toward the camera, before switching
                to an overview shot of him landing into the water, throwing it up high. As he turns
                upright again, the water around him instantly freezes, and he is locked in place.
                Cut to the surrounding ice spikes from which Water Tribe boats appear, each carrying
                several waterbenders, surrounding the team. Cut to a surprised looking Katara and an
                alarmed looking Sokka who is reaching for his boomerang atop the
                saddle.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a more far-off shot of the scene, revealing Appa to be frozen in the
                water, with six Water Tribe boats surrounding him.</description>
      <description>The scene switches to a Fire Navy base in the Fire Nation harbor. The
                camera cuts to inside a guarded tent, where Zhao is standing before a map of the
                Avatar World.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhao">He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhao">Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into.
            The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of
            war. The frozen tundra is treacherous, the landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll
            need a massive invasion force.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to the North Pole where the group is being escorted to
                the Northern Water Tribe. The magnificent wall of the city comes into view much to
                everyone's amazement.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A portion of the icy wall is lowered, allowing them to enter into the city.
                Canal workers use waterbending to transport the group into the city.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Fascinated.</charAction> I can't believe how many waterbenders live up
            here!</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>To Katara.</charAction> We'll find a master to teach us, no

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The team passes through the channels of the city, catching the attention of
                several civilians who run over to spectate them. Aang waves happily at the people.
                As they continue their trek inward, Sokka notices a young lady going by on a boat,
                capturing his attention. He blushes at the sight of her and leaps onto Appa's tail
                as she pulls away from view.</description>

      <description>The scene changes to nightfall, where Zuko's ship is docked in a port.
                Members of the crew have gathered for music night on the ship. Lieutenant Jee plays
                a lute as Iroh sings. Several other crew members play instruments or
                dance.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Singing.</charAction> Winter, spring ... Summer, and fall ... Winter,
            spring ... Summer, and fall ... Four seasons ... four loves ... Four seasons ... for
            love.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The music stops as they notice Admiral Zhao boarding the ship, along with
                two soldiers. The crew looks in surprise at the admiral. A high-pitched chord emits
                from the lute. The scene switches back to the Northern Water Tribe, where Team
                Avatar is being honored with a feast, hosted by the tribe's chief. Men play drums
                and a giant crab is set in a pool of water.</description>

      <speech speaker="Arnook">Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe.

      <description>Pakku and two students bend significant blobs of water, captivating Aang
                and Katara. They merge the three blobs into one stream, bending it around each
                other. Yue approaches Sokka.</description>

      <description>Embarrassed while sweating, Sokka stuffs food in his mouth. Screens widens

   <section>
      <description>Zhao notices a pair of swords on the wall. Cut to a close-up of Zhao's
                face, swollen in anger as he recognizes the blades. He flashes back to the Rescue in
                Pohuai Stronghold, where the same swords were wielded by the previously-unknown Blue
                Spirit. He takes one off the wall; cut to Zuko's face, his eyes wide and mouth open,
                clearly recognizing the danger he is in. Iroh, visible over Zuko's shoulder, does
                not. Cut back to Zhao, who begins practicing with the sword he has removed from the
                wall.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhao">He's real, all right. <charAction>He hands the broad sword to Iroh.</charAction>
            He's a criminal, and an enemy of the Fire Nation. But I have a feeling justice will
            catch up with him soon. <charAction>Zhao moves to exit the cabin.</charAction> General

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Wait! Aang didn't mean that! <charAction>Goes to Aang.</charAction> You can't risk

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!
                <charAction>Pakku comes down.</charAction> So, you decided to show up?
                <charAction>Pakku walks away.</charAction> Aren't you going to fight?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pakku">Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.
                <charAction>Katara tightens her fist and sends water whips at him. Pakku
                halts.</charAction> Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely!
                <charAction>He bends two streams of water from nearby pools and sends them both at a
                charging Katara, who falls back. He joins the two streams together, encircling both
                Katara and himself in a forceful ring of water.</charAction> Don't worry, I'm not
            going to hurt you!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara edges away from the ring and redirects the water away. The resulting
                blast hits Sokka. Pakku builds an ice wall in defense, which Katara slides up. She
                lands onto a nearby post. He melts the ice and directs the full blast at her.
                However, Katara freezes her feet down and is able to direct the blast
                away.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Determined.</charAction> You can't knock me down!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Some of the crowd cheers.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Go, Katara!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara charges at him; Pakku draws up a wall of ice, which she quickly
                liquefies. She attempts to land blows, but Pakku ducks them all. He whips water and
                throws her into a pool, earning the approval of other members of the
                crowd.</description>
      <description>Katara emerges from pool, shakes out her hair, and summons a small pillar
                of ice, where she proceeds to send a series of ice discs at her opponent. Pakku
                breaks up most of them using his wrists. The camera closes up to a slow-motion shot
                of one coming very close to hitting him. He looks at her in irritation. Katara, now
                back on the ground, attacks by sending a stream of water at him. However, Pakku
                generates it into a larger stream of water and sends it full force at her. Katara is
                sent back several feet. A close-up shot of her shows her bent over, breathing hard.
                She rises suddenly and sends two snow pillars down at him which Pakku turns to a
                dusty mist of snow. The mist clears.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pakku">Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">But you still won't teach me, will you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Pakku">No.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara bends over sharply, sending a wave of ice at Pakku, who merely
                raises himself onto an ice pillar. He proceeds to liquefy the pillar, charging
                straight at Katara, who sends a powerful stream of water his way. Pakku avoids the
                attack, instead managing to freeze Katara's stream of water which he slides across.
                He surges past her and strikes her down, knocking her necklace off in the process.
                Katara falls roughly to the ground as Pakku lands onto the rim of a pool, bends a
                tower of water and manipulates the stream overhead his opponent. He deftly freezes
                the water into several ice shards, which he sends down at Katara. She becomes
                trapped in the flurry of frozen daggers and appears still for a moment. The crowd
                gasps in horror; one child looks away in fear. Katara lifts her head and begins to
                struggle, attempting to break free as Pakku casually strolls away.</description>
