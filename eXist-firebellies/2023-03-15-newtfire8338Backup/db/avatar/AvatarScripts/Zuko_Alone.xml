      <description>The episode begins with Zuko by himself, riding his stolen ostrich horse
                through a fairly barren landscape. After walking for a bit, they arrive at a
                decrepit bridge over a ravine that breaks as they cross. After regaining control,
                they continue crossing. A little while later, Zuko smells food and spots a steak
                being cooked by a couple below the ridge he is walking on. He holds his stomach in
                hunger, and reaches for his dual dao swords, preparing himself to steal from them.
                However, after noticing that the woman is pregnant, he stops himself and continues
                on his way.</description>
      <description>Riding through grasslands covered in large broken Earth Kingdom rocks, Zuko
                holds his water pouch to his lips for a drink, only to finish it off thirstily.
                Exhausted from his travels, his sight becoming blurry and his eyes closing slowly as
                he struggles to maintain consciousness. He shakes himself awake, only to close his
                eyes again moments later. He has a flashback of a beautiful, middle-aged woman in a
                cloak turning and walking away in a dark hallway. He opens his eyes but keeps his
                head down.</description>
      <description>Under the hot sun, Zuko reaches a small, poor town where the buildings are
                mostly made of wood and seem to be poorly constructed. We come upon four men dressed
                in green, gambling.</description>

      <speech speaker="Earth Kingdom soldier">Come on, spidersnake eyes! <charAction>He rolls a pair of dice and they land with
                two fives, face-up.</charAction> Ha! Ha! Yeah!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Two of the other men turn around and punch him in the stomach once each. He
                grunts with each punch.</description>
      <description>Zuko rides through town and passes the soldiers. Their leader, Gow, glares
                at him and Zuko glares back. Zuko stops, gets off of his ostrich horse and turns to
                a merchant at a store.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">Could I get some water, a bag of feed and something hot to eat? <charAction>Zuko
                holds out his hand. In it are two coins.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Store owner">Not enough here for a hot meal. I can get you two bags of feed.</speech>

      <description>Zuko looks down, disappointed. He notices that the four Earth Kingdom men
                are watching him.</description>
      <description>Two children hide behind the store counter, looking amused. One of them
                giggles and throws an egg. It hits a gambling soldier.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Earth Kingdom soldier">Ow!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The two boys run off as the Earth Kingdom soldier turn around, looking
                angry. They only see Zuko behind them, so they stand up indignantly.</description>

      <description>The Earth Kingdom soldier laughs, and Gow glares at him. At that moment,
                the store owner returns with Zuko's feed bags for the ostrich horse. Gow goes to the
                counter and grabs both bags before he can take them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gow">Thanks for your contribution. The army appreciates your support. <charAction>He
                throws the bags to one of his fellow soldiers.</charAction> You better leave town.
            Penalty for stayin's a lot steeper than you can afford, stranger. Trust me.
                <charAction>He pats his hammer at his side menacingly.</charAction>

      <description>Zuko walks toward his ostrich horse. As he is about to re-mount, one of the
                little boys from earlier pops up from behind the animal.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Lee">Thanks for not ratting me out!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko ignores the boy, gets on his steed and starts riding away. Lee casts
                him an annoyed look before brightening. Lee comes up from behind and grabs the
                reins.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Lee">I'll take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you. Come on, I owe you!

      <description>A shot of Zuko holding his stomach in hunger fades to a pig farm, Zuko and
                Lee arrive on a dirt road at the farm among mountains in the countryside. A little
                wooden farmhouse with a roof that needs re-shingling. Several different types of
                hybrid pigs spotted in enclosures.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Lee takes the ostrich horse away. Zuko casts his glance off to the side;
                the camera shifts to show a pig rooster, who crows at him. A man approaches Zuko. A
                woman peers out from behind the farmhouse.</description>

      <speech speaker="Gansu">You a friend of Lee's?</speech>

            Anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here. Those men
            should be ashamed to wear Earth Kingdom uniforms.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Sela">The real soldiers are off fighting the War, <charAction>Cuts to shot of

      <speech speaker="Zuko">I can't. I should be moving on. <charAction>The wife frowns and casts a glance at

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sela">Gansu could use some help on the barn. Why don't you two work for a while, and then
            we'll eat.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko nods in agreement. The camera fades to Zuko and Gansu working on the
                roof of the barn. Lee is resting on a ladder, watching them re-shingle the roof.
                While Gansu is doing well and working steadily, Zuko has several twisted and broken
                nails in front of him, although it is evident he is trying hard to do a good
                job.</description>

                <charAction>Pause.</charAction> So how'd you get that scar?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko is surprised at the question and swings down his hammer a little too
                hard. He strikes his thumb, now red, and groans in pain.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gansu">It's not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about. A
            man's past is his business.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Gansu goes back to hammering and so does Zuko. The scene fades away to the
                sound of hammers hitting metal as Zuko starts reminiscing about the
                past.</description>
      <description>Fade to a shot of the water's surface. An unknown person places a fingertip
                in the water and holds their hand out to reveal bread crumbs. Cuts to shot of the
                Royal Gardens, two figures sitting by the edge of a large kidney-shaped pond. Cuts
                to shot of a younger Zuko and his mother, who are feeding some bread to four turtle
                ducks – a mother and her four babies.</description>

      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">Ow! Ow ow! Ouch! <charAction>Ursa removes the turtle duck from Zuko and gently

      <description>A little while later, young Azula, Ty Lee and Mai are playing together in
                the royal yard by a man-made river and a rather large fountain. While Mai sits and
                watches under the shade of a tree, Azula does a complicated flip but messes up the
                ending and grunts. Ty Lee does the same flip, only she completes the ending
                perfectly and lands on her feet, arms proudly up in the air. Azula pushes her over
                and laughs.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Ty Lee">Ugh! Azula!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko and Ursa walk by together nearby. Mai sees them, smiles, turns away
                and blushes. Azula notices her obvious crush, however, and turns to Ty Lee with a
                plot in mind.</description>

      <description>Azula reaches for an apple on the tree that Mai was under earlier. Mai, now

            do is, try to knock the apple off the other person's head, like this. <charAction>Azula
                shots a small jet of flame to the apple with her firebending and knowingly sets it
                on fire.</charAction>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko is shocked and runs forward toward Mai, who screams as Zuko approaches
                her. He slams into her and the both of them fall into the fountain, with Zuko lying
                on top of Mai's stomach. Both seem very shocked and embarrassed. Azula starts
                laughing at them.</description>

                surround a large gap in the wall of Ba Sing Se with smoke emitting from everywhere.
                A tent is set up nearby, with a younger General Iroh writing at a

      <description>Flashback ends. Night has fallen, and Zuko is sleeping on a pile of hay
                inside the barn. A door opens and Lee comes sneaking in. He takes the Dual Dao
                swords, but nearly stops when Zuko makes a sound in his sleep. Nevertheless, Lee
                walks out of the barn with the swords and closes the squeaky door. Zuko's eyes pop
                open as if he was only feigning sleep the whole time. Cut to a large sunflower
                garden, where Lee is practicing with the swords. He jumps around and chops off
                several sunflower heads. He starts stabbing a nearby dead tree trunk repeatedly, his
                tongue lolling out of his mouth and breathes heavily in effort as Zuko silently
                approaches behind him.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Lee falls backward in surprise. The shot shows Zuko, arms crossed, standing
                a little further back in the patch of sunflowers. Lee gets back up, ashamed, and
                holds out the swords to Zuko. He takes them.</description>
   </section>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">Keep in mind, these are dual swords. Two halves of a single weapon. Don't think of
            them as separate, 'cause they're not. They're just two different parts of the same
            whole.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko swings around the swords carefully, demonstrating his skill. He cuts
                off some sunflower heads, turns around, and hands the swords back to Lee to try. Lee
                is a little more careful this time, and a little less awkward with the swords. He
                turns to Zuko once he is done his mini demonstration. Zuko smiles kindly; Lee smiles
                back and laughs. They begin walking away from the sunflower patch together, side by
                side under the full moon.</description>

      <description>Fade to the morning at the pig farm. Zuko mounts his ostrich horse again,
                ready to leave the hospitable family. Gansu, Sela and Lee have all come to see Zuko
                off.</description>

      <description>Zuko is just about to grab the package when he looks up and notices a cloud

      <description>Gow and his crew ride toward the pig farm. The animals squeal, clearly

      <description>Gow turns around his ostrich horse and all four soldiers ride away, kicking
                up a cloud of dust behind them. Cut to another one of Zuko's flashbacks in the
                palace grounds again and to the fountain seen earlier. Zuko and Azula are happily
                playing together while Ursa sits in front of the fountain when a messenger in white
                approaches her with a scroll. She opens and reads it before standing up and crying.
                She turns to young Zuko and Azula.</description>

                at all. Cut back to the present, where Zuko is still in front of the family
                protectively. Sela and Gansu are hugging behind him; Lee is standing close
                by.</description>

                but stops shortly afterward. Cut to Zuko's memory again; this time he is in the
                Royal Palace playing with his dagger from Iroh (the one he just gave to Lee.) He
                fakes his death, dramatically falling to the floor with a groan. Azula sits

   <section>
      <description>The scene changes to the Fire Lord's chamber, a large room with many
                columns and a wall of fire in front of the Fire Lord's throne. Ozai, Ursa, Zuko, and
                Azula are all sitting on the floor some distance back from Fire Lord Azulon, though
                Ozai's face remains obscured save for his mouth.</description>

      <speech speaker="Ozai">Correct, my dear. Now, would you show Grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to

   <section>
      <description>Azula stands up and moves forward. She begins with some circular motions,
                warms herself up, and firebends. Ozai smiles. Azula does many fairly complicated
                moves with ease, and Zuko watches her in amazement. She finishes off her routine
                with a jump and a powerful fire blast toward the throne, before landing on her feet
                gracefully.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Ozai frowns at this news. Zuko starts off well, doing the same circular
                motions as Azula earlier. He manages to produce a small fire blast, which does not
                impress Fire Lord Azulon. When he tries to create another one, he falls. He gets
                back up, panting heavily, and tries again, only to fall harder. Ursa gets up
                worriedly and approaches Zuko to comfort him.</description>

      <description>Ursa, Zuko and Azula start walking out of the throne room; however, Azula
                pulls Zuko off to the side just before they exit. The children hide in the curtains

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ozai">Father, you must have realized as I have, that with Lu Ten gone, Iroh's bloodline
            has ended. After his son's death, my brother abandoned the siege at Ba Sing Se, and who

   <section>
      <description>Azulon's anger causes the flames around him to grow. Zuko, scared, runs
                away from behind the curtain as Azula watches, but she stays and continues watching
                with an evil smile on her face.</description>
      <description>The scene switches to Zuko laying in a large bed in a large ornate room. He
                suddenly looks up, alarmed. Azula is standing in his doorway, arms crossed. She

                when they see him coming. Lee is tied up to a tower. He seems sad, but when he looks

      <description>The soldier runs forward, spear in hand. He goes to attack Zuko, who pulls
                out his sword and punches the other man in the stomach with the hilt without fully
                unsheathing his sword. Zuko re-sheathes his sword while the man slides backward and
                runs away, panting heavily in fear.</description>
      <description>A second Earth Kingdom soldier groans and runs to attack Zuko with his
                spear this time. Zuko punches the spear upward to move it out of the way, grabs onto
                the man's forehead, and shoves him to the ground. The man gets up slowly and flees
                as well.</description>
      <description>A third Earth Kingdom soldier charges toward Zuko with his spear as well.
                Zuko stands there, waiting, until the spear is close enough and kicks the spear
                right in the middle, snapping it. The spearhead, along with half of the spear, goes
                flying in the other direction. The soldier gasps and runs away from Zuko like the
                two men before him. Lee laughs in satisfaction. A crowd has gathered; Sela's worried
                face is one of many.</description>
      <description>With the last of his cronies gone, Gow steps up to the plate to fight Zuko,
                dual hammers against dual swords. They draw their weapons, and Gow throws the first
                blow, a rock he has earthbent, and powerfully thrusts over to Zuko. Zuko deflects it
                readily with his swords. Gow strikes again, this time with three large rocks instead
                of one. He sends them over in rapid succession to Zuko, who deflects the first two
                easily. However, the third rock hits him in the stomach and he stumbles backward.
                This does not dismay him though, so he charges Gow. An old man in the crowd cheers
                him on.</description>

      <description>Gow does the same earthbending trick as earlier; he throws three large
                rocks at Zuko. Zuko responds the same as before, deflecting the first two but the
                third one hitting him square in the abdomen. However, this time, he falls over and
                somersaults backward, and manages to get up, although weakened and still stumbling
                around. Gow smiles.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Gow earthbends again, but with increasingly larger rocks each time. He
                shoots four rocks at Zuko, who manages to destroy each, one by one. It continues
                this way, Gow no longer giving little recovery breaks to Zuko. Both are fighting at
                full force, although Zuko is so busy being defensive of the large flying rocks that
                he cannot become offensive to Gow. However, finally Gow creates a rockalanche and
                directs it at Zuko. The crowd gasps collectively. Zuko is sent flying and lands
                straight on his back, and has a sudden flashback.</description>
      <description>In the flashback, Zuko is sleeping in his room at night when a hand gently
                touches his shoulder. He awakens drowsily to see his mother dressed in a
                cloak.</description>

      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">... Mom?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Ursa">Zuko, please, my love, listen to me. Everything I've done, I've done to protect
            you.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>She pulls the barely conscious Zuko into a hug.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Ursa">Remember this, Zuko. No matter how things may seem to change, never forget who you
            are.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>She turns away from him with a sad smile, pulls her hood up and disappears
                down the dark hallway; it is the flashback Zuko had at the very beginning of the
                episode.</description>
      <description>The flashback ends as suddenly as it begin, and we cut back to Zuko in the
                Earth Kingdom village, lying on the ground. Gow is approaching him.</description>

      <description>Gow raises his hammers to deliver the final blow when Zuko's eyes open. He
                reaches for his swords and gets up firebending, creating a hurricane of flame. Gow
                drops his hammers and is pushed over, and lands on his back. Zuko stands there,
                seething at Gow. Although unarmed, Gow stands up and raises his fists, determined to
                finish the fight. Zuko charges him, sending various fire blasts. Gow tries to
                deflect them with earthbending, but the blasts are too powerful and he is sent
                backward again. Rocks hit his head as he lands in with a cloud of
                dust.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Gow">Who ... who are you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">My name is Zuko. Son of Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Prince of the Fire Nation, and heir
            to the throne.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Old man">Liar! I heard of you! You're not a prince, you're an outcast! His own father burned
            and disowned him!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko kneels down toward Gow, who shudders in fear. However, Zuko does
                nothing to harm him; he only takes Lee's dagger back. Zuko walks toward Lee to give
                it back, but Sela (who had been untying Lee) intervenes. </description>

      <speech speaker="Sela">Not a step closer.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Zuko kneels down in front of Sela, with Lee peeking around his mother's
                back, offering the knife.</charAction> It's yours. You should have it.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Lee">No! I hate you!</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko has another flashback. It is probably early morning and he is in his
                bed in his room. He wakes with a start.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">Mom? <charAction>Zuko leaps out of bed and runs out of his room down the
                hallway.</charAction> Mom? Mom!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko enters a pillared room, where Azula is admiring Zuko's dagger from
                behind a pillar. She re-sheathes it and steps out to face Zuko.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">Where's Mom?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Azula">No one knows. Oh, and last night, Grandpa passed away.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">Not funny, Azula! You're sick. And I want my knife back, now. <charAction>Zuko tries
                to grab it, but misses as Azula quickly moves out of the way, and loudly
                grunts.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Azula">
         <charAction>Tauntingly.</charAction> Who's going to make me?
                Mom?&gt;
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko dashes forward and grabs his knife from Azula, who was dangling in a
                tantalizing manner. He runs away to keep looking. Zuko reaches the garden where his
                father is standing still, staring into a pond.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Young Zuko">Where is she?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Ozai does not acknowledge that he has heard Zuko. Zuko bows his
                head.</description>
      <description>The scene switches to the palace from the outside on the stairs, outside at
                night. Row upon row of people standing on the palace grounds, wearing red hooded
                cloaks and carrying long, red, rectangular flags. At the top of the steps to the
                palace, a Fire Sage leader dressed in red, with several other Fire Sages in white
                behind him. There is an elaborate coffin behind him as well. Zuko, Azula, and Ozai
                are standing to his right.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fire Sage">Azulon. Fire Lord to our nation for twenty-three years. You were our fearless leader
            in the Battle of Garsai. Our matchless conqueror of the Hu Xin Provinces. You were
            father of Iroh, father of Ozai, husband of Ilah, now passed. Grandfather of Lu Ten, now
            passed. Grandfather of Zuko, and Azula. We lay you to rest.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>With those words, two attendants in white firebend Azulon's coffin, which
                was on a layer of wood so it burns easily. The Fire Sage holds up the fire
                crown.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fire Sage">As was your dying wish, you are now succeeded by your second son.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He places the fire crown in Ozai's top knot and steps away.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fire Sage">Hail Fire Lord Ozai!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Ozai stands up, and the group of mourners wearing red and holding flags all
                kneel down at once, as do the Fire Sages behind him and Zuko and Azula. Azula is
                smiling wickedly at this new development. Zuko looks over at her and the crowd with
                absolute fear in his eyes. The flashback ends.</description>
      <description>Zuko rides out of the Earth Kingdom village on his stolen ostrich horse.
                The villagers stand in lines on either side of him with various possible weapons in
                their hands: a hoe, a pitchfork, a rock for throwing. They watch him leave with
                anger and hatred in their eyes. As Zuko passes Lee, the boy looks the other way.
                Zuko ignores them, and rides off into the sunset, just as alone as when he
                arrived.</description>
