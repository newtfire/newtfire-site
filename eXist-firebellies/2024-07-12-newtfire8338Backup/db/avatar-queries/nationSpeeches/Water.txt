My scrolls!  There's no time!  That's correct! I hope that's okay.  Look! They made a giant Kyoshi float!  Aang, look!  Hey, what's that guy doing? Why not? Aang helps people.  Aang would never do something like that. No Avatar would. And it's not fair for you all to question his honor!  I think what "Master Swish" is trying to say is that you're supposed to be out saving the world. You can't do that locked up in here.  Yeah! Back home, he was famous for solving the mystery of the missing seal jerky.  So if they were built at the same time, that means– That's a big hole in the mayor's story, but it's not enough to prove Aang's innocence.  Where did you get that?  He couldn't be here, Koko. Oyaji! Aang is in jail. The town of Chin says he murdered their leader in a past life.  She had exquisite taste.  These were her boots? Her feet must have been enormous!  Wait a minute ... big feet? Little footprint? There's no way–  You're right. I'm sorry. Please.  Brilliant, Sokka.  They point east. So the sun must have been in the west. Honorable Mayor, we've prepared a solid defense for the Avatar. We did an investigation and found some very strong evidence. Mayor Tong, I'd like for the court to hear one last testimony. This isn't just any witness. I'm going to call ... Avatar Kyoshi herself!  Well, she is Aang's past life. Maybe wearing her stuff will trigger something.  Please! If you could just wait one more second, I'm sure Kyoshi will be here!  Uhhh ... you kind of confessed. Sorry.  Community service! Please stop on community service! Happy Avatar Day, everyone!  Did someone lose something?  Wait, look!  Is this dad's boat?   Bato! Is he here? Bato, it looks like home!   No way! Stewed sea prunes! Bato, is it true that you and dad lassoed an arctic hippo? Everyone does!  You and Dad had so many hilarious adventures.  Really? I do really miss him, it would be great to see Dad.  Even if we do have time to wait for the message, who knows how far we'd have to travel. We don't have time for a long detour.  Hey, Aang, I didn't notice you left. He never got to go. Dad left before he was old enough. There's no way through! Of course you can!  Aang, what are you talking about?  I'm with you Sokka. Good luck.  That wolf sounds so sad. Sokka?  You're right.  Aang! We're getting you to the North Pole. And we need you. I'll be okay.  Aang, how'd you get that? Aw, that's so sweet of Zuko. Could you give him a kiss for me when you see him?  Hey, you never called me Sifu Katara. I don't understand what went wrong. He did it exactly the way you did.  I've been training Aang for a while now. He really responds well to a positive teaching experience. Lots of encouragement and praise. Kind words. If he's doing something wrong, maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction. Sorry Toph, but are you really sure this is the way to teach Aang earthbending?  Heh. Aang, it's no big deal. You'll take a break and try earthbending again when you're ready. Besides, you still have a lot of waterbending to work on. Okay? You know this block you're having is only temporary, right? You do realize that's the problem, don't you? If you face this issue instead of avoiding it– Aang, if fire and water are opposites, then what's the opposite of air? That's why it's so difficult for you to get this. You're working with your natural opposite. But you'll figure it out. I know you will. Think fast! Excellent. You have the reflexes of a waterbending master. Hey Aang, have you seen– It's important. It's almost sundown and Sokka isn't back yet. I think we should search for him. You found him!  You did it! I knew you would! You tried the positive reinforcement, didn't you?  Look, the Inner Wall! I can't believe we finally made it to Ba Sing Se in one piece.  Don't worry Aang, we'll find Appa. What's that wall for?  Why do they have all these poor people blocked off in one part of the city?  What's inside that wall?  Get in trouble with who?! I got it! I know how we're going to see the Earth King!  The king is having a party at the palace tonight for his pet bear. No, it just says 'bear'.  Just ... bear.  The palace will be packed. We can sneak in with the crowd!  Why not?  Excuse me? I've> got no manners?! You're not exactly "lady fancy fingers!"  We'll get in the party, and then find a way to let you in through the side gate.  Sir, I'm sorry to bother you, but my cousin lost our invitations. She's blind. Do you think you could help us? Our family's inside and I'm sure they're very worried.  I'm Kwa Mai, and this is ... Dum. Ow!  Uh ... I don't see them right now, but I'm sure we'll find them soon. Thanks for all your help.  Sorry, but the guy who escorted us in won't> let us out of his sight!  So the king is just a figurehead. You can't keep the truth from all these people. They have to know.  What happened to Joo Dee? Seriously ... what else you got? An earthbender!  Hello there! I'm Katara! What's your name?  I just wanted to say hi.  Which means no nuts for dinner!  Hey ...  Hey. You're that kid. Why did you run away before?  But, Haru's an earthbender? He can help! How can you say that? Haru has a gift! Asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend. It's a part of who we are. I understand that Haru can help you fight back. What can the Fire Nation do to you that they haven't done already? I'm sorry about what I said earlier. I didn't know about your father.  Thanks. He sounds like a great man. So that's why you hide your earthbending.  See this necklace? My mother gave it to me. I lost my mother in a Fire Nation raid. This necklace is all I have left of her. No.   Ugh! It's not working! We have to get help!  Haru. There's a way you can help him. Please, there's no one around to see you. It's the only way!  Haru! You did it!  It was so brave of Haru to use his earthbending to help that old man. I guess so.  Dawn?! Can't we sleep in for once?  I'd rather eat fireballs than nuts.  They took him! They took Haru away!  The old man turned him in to the Fire Nation - it's all my fault - I forced him into earthbending! Haru's mother said they came for him at midnight.  We don't need to track him. The Fire Nation is going to take me right to Haru.  Because they're going to arrest me for earthbending.   Aang? Did you get all that?  How dare you call me pipsqueak, you giant-eared cretin!  A giant-eared cretin! Look at those things! Do herds of animals use them for shade?!   I will not back off! I bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are! I'll show you who's boss! Earthbending style! I said, earthbending style!  Haru!  It's my fault you were captured. I came to rescue you. It was the only way to find you.  It's an honor to meet you. If you don't mind me asking, what's your escape plan? You know, the plan to get everyone off the rig? What is it? Mutiny, sabotage?  How can you say that? You sound like you've already given up!  We'll see about that. Earthbenders! You don't know me, but I know of you. Every child in my Water Tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave Earth Kingdom, and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders. Some of you may think that the Fire Nation has made you powerless. Yes, they have taken away your ability to bend. But they can't take away your courage. And it is your courage they should truly fear! Because it runs deeper than any mine you've been forced to dig, any ocean that keeps you far from home! It is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are. Hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away. The time to fight back is now! I can tell you the Avatar has returned! So remember your courage earthbenders, let us fight for our freedom! I can't. I'm not leaving. I'm not giving up on these people. We can't abandon these people! There has to be a way to help them.  No! I tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but, it didn't work! If there was just a way to help them help themselves.  But this entire place is made of metal! It's almost dawn. We're running out of time! You sure this is gonna work?  Here's your chance, earthbenders! Take it! Your fate is in your own hands!  All it took was a little coal. So, I guess you're going home now. I can't. Your mission is to take back your home. Ours is to get Aang to the North Pole.  I know. My mother's necklace! It's gone! What? Appa's not too noticeable!  Who made you the boss?  You're the leader? But your voice still cracks!  If anyone's the leader, it's Aang. I mean he is the Avatar.  Why do boys always think someone has to be the leader? I bet you wouldn't be so bossy if you kissed a girl.  Who? Gran-Gran? I've met Gran-Gran.  Okay, we'll try it your way, oh wise leader.  Well I don't know, Aang. Why don't you ask Sokka's instincts? They seem to know everything. You know who you should ask to carry it for a while? Sokka's instincts.   What are you doing?  Look! Hi.  Umm, thanks for saving us Jet. We're lucky you were there.  We were relying on instincts.  Yes, we wanna see it! It's beautiful up here!  Why does the Fire Nation want to find you? That's so brave.  Don't pay any attention to my brother. So, you all live here?  What about you? Sokka and I lost our mother to the Fire Nation. Hey Jet, nice speech. Well, he's great. He's the Avatar. I could use some more training. Hey, Sokka. Is Jet back? But I made him this hat.  What? No, he's not. I wanna hear Jet's side of the story.  No, he conveniently left that part out. I knew there was an explanation. See, Sokka? I'm sure you just didn't notice the knife. We can't leave now with the Fire Nation about to burn down a forest! You know what I think? You're jealous that he's a better warrior and a better leader! Well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help Jet. Come on Aang. Jet, I'm sorry about how Sokka's been acting. Yeah, I did. I'm glad he cooled off. He's so stubborn sometimes. I've never used bending on water I can't see. I don't know ...  When we're done we'll meet you over there. Let's catch up with Jet at the reservoir. Well, we finished early. I'm sure he'll be happy to see us. What are they doing? Why would they need blasting jelly?  What? No, that would destroy the town. Jet wouldn't do that.   Jet wouldn't do that. Jet, why? This isn't the answer! Where's Sokka?  Why, Jet? I can't believe I trusted you. You lied to me, you're sick and I trusted you! What are you doing?  No! Come on, Sokka. I'm sorry I ever doubted you, please.  No ... All those people ... Jet, you monster! Sokka! Goodbye Jet.  Let me guess, your instincts told you.  We found a printer to make our posters!   Why are feet coming out of it? Let's just stick with the professional version. It's only been a day. Just be patient.   But then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was Joo Dee.  Tell it to some other girl, Jet!  Jet's back. We can't trust anything Jet says. I don't care why he's here, whatever the reason is, it can't be good! You're lying! All right. But we're not letting you out of our sight.  If this is a trap– Aang, it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the Earth Kingdom. And then we'll need to find a boat to get to the island. Don't you have some more hair to clean up? You're right Aang, right now our first concern has to be finding Appa. We can come back when we have him. We don't need your help! Gee, I wonder. What ... no!   I thought you said you didn't have your "gang" anymore!  The Dai Li?! That's impossible. The Dai Li must have sent Jet to mislead us, and that janitor was part of their plot, too! Maybe you should kiss him, Sokka! Close your eyes. Picture it. Maybe this will help.  This isn't good. We're not going to leave you. Nice choice, Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule. Sokka's got the right idea, Aang. We're here. We're ready. The best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.  Hey. How long have you been up?  You know, there is such a thing as over-training. Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep. Aang, sleep. Please. For me.  Aang! I know you're just trying to help, but you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling.  Sokka! You're not helping! You know what, I've got just the thing! Get ready to be de-stressified! These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up. Reach for the sun. Feel your chi paths clearing. Now close your eyes. How are you feeling? Good, good. Go on. Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out. So, do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night's sleep? What happened, Aang?  You don't look so good. You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap? Aang, staying up all night can't be good for you. What big things? Aang, what are you saying?  What are we doing? Aang! I was just saying you should take a nap. What was your dream about?  Sounds neat! Aang? We're all starting to get a little worried about you.  Aang ... I'm not going to hit you.  Listen to me. You've been training for this since the day we met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.  This is horrible, but we have to move on. I know you had your heart set on Bumi, but there are other people who can teach you earthbending. That wasn't as bad as I thought. Sorry. We were just on our way home. Uh, he has pentapox, sir. Umm, it's highly contagious. And deadly. Let's find Bumi and get out of here. Aang, what are you doing? Aren't you coming with us?  Oh no. Did someone get left behind?  Oooh, you're so cute. Mmmmm ... Does that look like the face of a killer to you? We've got to get the baby out of here! There's Aang! Wow, this is amazing to watch. The fire is gonna destroy that town!  There's a creek over here. I'll bend the water onto the fire.  What's your problem? You haven't even touched your smoked sea slug. That's not true. No one can read a map like you. What? What's wrong with my hair?   I'm sorry you're feeling so down, but I hope you know, none of us see you that way. I know something that's going to make you feel better. What's a wind sword?  Yeah ... nice.  That's a great idea. I could've never gotten to where I am without Master Pakku. Everyone needs a teacher. Sokka's been in charge of the schedule. I'm not sure what we should be doing.  I-It's so hot, it's so hot ... Momo is shedding like Appa. Huh, huh‌? Oh, everyone's a critic. So where are we going next‌? We're starting from here ... Ooh, I got one: if you miss him so much, why don't you marry him‌?  We missed you so much! But why would you agree to train someone from the Water Tribe‌? What does it mean‌? You know, I don't think there's such a thing as "space earth". If it's from space, then it's not really "earth". I can't believe I missed you.  I'm not his girlfriend!  I have Aang's staff. Not just any old people. These are great masters and friends of ours. Pakku.  That's so exciting! You and Gran-Gran must be so happy to have found each other again!  And this was Aang's first firebending teacher. Are you okay?  Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right? Then he'll forgive you. He will. It would be my pleasure. Goodbye, General Iroh. I think I'm the one who should be thanking you. That's very thoughtful of you, Sokka. Wait, why did you give me Momo's ears?  But, there's nothing here. Do they have bathrooms in the Spirit World? You mean, after all Roku and Sozin went through together, even after Roku showed him mercy, Sozin betrayed him like that‌?  Oh, Sokka, just hold hands. Water. Earth. Fire. Air. Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then, everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all four elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed, and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world.  Aang didn't do anything! It was an accident.  Sokka, you're making a mistake.  Aang is not our enemy! Don't you see? Aang's brought us something we haven't had in a long time: fun.  Grandmother, please. Don't> let Sokka do this!  Fine! Then I'm banished, too! Come on Aang, let's go.  To find a waterbender. Aang is taking me to the North Pole.  So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?  Where will you go?  You happy now? There goes my one >chance at becoming a waterbender!  Sokka, get out of the way!  Aang?  No! Aang, don't> do this!  We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe, now we have to save him.  Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and --  Sokka!   He's not my --  There's no way we're going to catch a warship with a canoe.>  Appa!   Please, Appa. We need your help. Aang needs your help. Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa. Come on, don't you want to save Aang?   You did it, Sokka!  Aang! No!  Aang! Aang! Aang!  Did you see what he just did?!  Aang! Are you okay?  Hurry up, Sokka!  How did you do that?! With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen!  Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar? But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war. According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?  Well, if we go to the North Pole, you can master waterbending!  And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.  Then we're in this together!  What's there?   Aang ... Do you want to talk about it?  Thank you, Master Pakku.  Say hi to Gran-Gran for me!  Mighty Katara? I like that.  Aang still needs to master all four elements.  No, nothing's decided. We already have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.  Aang, no! This is not the right way! There's a right way to do this. Practice, study, and discipline!  If you two meat heads want to throw away everything we've worked for, fine, go ahead and glow it up!  Can we talk about something?  Do you remember when we were at the air temple and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton? It must have been so horrible and traumatic for you. I saw you get so upset that you weren't even you anymore. I'm not saying the Avatar State doesn't have incredible and helpful power ... but you have to understand ... for the people who love you, watching you be in that much rage and pain is really scary.  I don't understand.  I can't watch you do this to yourself. I'm not coming tomorrow. Good night. I wonder what crazy thing they're trying to do now. Maybe we should just make sure Aang's okay.  What's going on?  I can't move!  Aang, I'm sinking!   Please!  I think we're all set. Aang, you're awake!   You're not dreaming. You're finally awake. You need to take it easy, okay? You got hurt pretty bad. I like your hair. A few weeks.  We're fine, Dad.  He knows who you are. I just called you "Dad", didn't I? Great, great, so now you guys have finally met. So would you mind giving us a little privacy?  What, not at all. Why would you say that? Maybe we should go upstairs. You need a healing session. Tell me where the pain feels most intense. I can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there. Let me just see if I can- I just used the spirit water from the North Pole. I don't know what I did exactly.  You need to rest.   It's Sokka's> invasion plan.  Aang, wait! Remember, they don't know we're not Fire Nation!  This is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole. It has special properties so I've been saving it for something important. I'm gonna give us some cover!  You guys go ahead without us. We'll catch up to you. I think I understand why being a secret bothers you so much. You don't want people to think you failed. Aang, that's not true. It's not for good. Remember, there's still a plan. The invasion!  Aang ...  Is there anything you need? I brought you some food! Oh no ...  He left. Aang. He just took his glider and disappeared. He has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone, that it's all his responsibility. It's not brave, it's selfish and stupid! We could be helping him and I know the world needs him, but doesn't he know how much we need him, too? How can he just leave us behind? How could you leave us, Dad? I mean, I know we had Gran-Gran, and she loved us, but we were just so lost without you.  I understand why you left. I really do, and I know that you had to go, so why do I still feel this way? I'm so sad and angry and hurt! You're okay! I know, but you'll have our help.  There are walls all around us. It's completely safe.  I don't think so. I get the feeling he knows who we are. Then you should get it, you deserve something nice. All right, then don't. Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking for.  I'll take care of this. Hey, strong guys! Wait up!  You ready to find an earthbending teacher? Because we're going to Earth Rumble VI! Oh ... a girl has her ways.   This is just going to be a bunch of guys chucking rocks at each other, isn't it?  How about The Boulder? He's got some good moves. She can't really be blind. It's just part of her character, right? How did she do that?  Don't boo at him!  That is a big relief.  Yeah, I didn't think so.  Let me handle this. You're not telling us everything! Hey, I got my eye on you. You're the one whose bag matches his belt.  What Aang is trying to say is, he's the Avatar. And if he doesn't master earthbending soon, he won't be able to defeat the Fire Lord. "If you want to see your daughter again, bring five hundred gold pieces to the arena." It's signed Xin Fu and The Boulder. We're going with you. What about Aang? Toph, there's too many of them. We need an earthbender. We need you! Don't worry, we'll find you a teacher. There are plenty of amazing earthbenders out there.  This should bring your fever down. That's nice. I'll tell him. Not so good, being out in that storm really did a number on him. Aang, he's in no condition for travel. Sokka just needs more rest. I'm sure he'll be better by tomorrow.  Relax, it was just a little cough. I'm fi-   Listen carefully, Momo. I need you to take this to the river, and fill it with water. Got it?   Momo should be back any minute.  Ugh! No, Momo, water. Wa-ter! Aang, what in the world is taking you so long?  How many times do I have to tell you, Momo? We need water, wa-ter. Oh forget it. Aang, please, hurry. Sure.  Right ... maybe that's because he remembers the whole thing. "Need meat. Gone fishing. Back in a few days. Sokka and Zuko." One more thing. "Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badgerfrog croak. Zuko." What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?  Dad?  How are you here? What is going on? Where did you go? Water. Earth. Fire. Air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days: a time of peace when the Avatar kept balance between the Water Tribes, Earth Kingdom, Fire Nation and Air Nomads. But that all changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements; only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years have passed, and the Fire Nation is nearing victory in the war. Two years ago, my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the Earth Kingdom to help fight against the Fire Nation, leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe. Some people believe that the Avatar was never reborn into the Air Nomads and that the cycle is broken, but I haven't lost hope. I still believe that, somehow, the Avatar will return to save the world.  Sokka, look!  But, Sokka! I caught one!  Hey!  It's not "magic", it's waterbending! And it's ...  You're calling me weird? I'm not the one who makes muscles at myself every time I see my reflection in the water! Watch out! Go left! Go left!  You call that left?>  So it's my fault? You are the most sexist, immature, nut brained ... I'm embarrassed to be related to you! Ever since mom died, I've been doing all the work around camp while you've> been off playing soldier!  I even wash all the clothes! Have you ever smelled your dirty socks? Let me tell you, not pleasant!> No that's it! I'm done helping you! From now on, you're on your own!>  You mean I >did that? He's alive! We have to help!  Stop it! What?  What is it?  Uh, sure ... I-I guess.  Oh yeah, I'm sure he's a spy for the Fire Navy. You can tell by that evil look in his eye. The paranoid one is my brother, Sokka. You never told us your name.  You're an airbender! We'd love a ride! Thanks!   Are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home? You know, before you freeze to death?  Why are you smiling at me like that? Hey. I guess I was wondering, your being an airbender and all, if you had any idea what happened to the Avatar? Okay. Just curious. Good night. Aang? Aang! Wake up. It's okay, we're in the village now! Come on, get ready. Everyone's waiting to meet you. Aang, this is the entire village. Entire village, Aang.  Aang, this is my grandmother.  That was amazing!>  Well, sort of. Not yet.  I told you, he's the real thing Gran-Gran! I finally found a bender to teach me! But he's special! I can tell! I sense he's filled with much wisdom.  Have you seen Aang? Gran-Gran said he disappeared over an hour> ago. Aang?  Hehehe, Aang, I'll help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending.  No. You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. Maybe, but we haven't had contact with our sister tribe in a long time. It's not exactly "turn right at the second glacier". It's on the other side of the world>.  That's ... I mean, I don't know. I've never left home before.  Okay, listen closely my young pupil. Catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art. Observe!  I haven't done this since I was a kid!  A Fire Navy ship. And a very bad memory for my people. Aang, stop! We're not allowed to go near it! The ship could be booby-trapped!  This ship has haunted my tribe since Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks. Aang, how long were you in that iceberg? I think it was more like a hundred years!> Think about it. The War is a century old. You don't know about it because, somehow, you were in there the whole time! It's the only explanation.  I'm sorry, Aang. Maybe somehow there's a bright side to all this ...  Come on, let's get out of here. Aang, let's head back, this place is creepy. Aaah!  What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?   Right, let me see your stance.  Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together, you protect your center. You got it?  Okay, let's see what you got.  You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang. We're not river people. Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi, so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe. Is this real or a legend?  That's no campfire, Moku. It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope. Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.  Everyone be quiet. Listen.  Aang, look! This isn't the exit. These pictures tell their story.  They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages ...  The villages were enemies, so they could not be together ... but their love was strong and they found a way.  The two lovers learned earthbending from the badgermoles; they became the first earthbenders.  They built elaborate tunnels, so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be forever in the labyrinth. But, one day, the man didn't come - he'd died in the war between the two villages. Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power - she could have destroyed them all ... but, instead, she declared the war over. Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace. The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.  Love is brightest in the dark. I have a crazy idea.  Never mind. It's too crazy. I was thinking ... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love ...  And here, it says, "Love is brightest in the dark," and has a picture of them kissing.  Well, what if we ... kissed? See? It was a crazy idea.  Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that‌>?  Oh, well! I didn't realize it was such a horrible option. Sorry I suggested it!  Ugh!  Well, I'm not sure which I'd rather do!  I think so ... What can we do? That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals. That must be the way out!  Let's go! Sokka! Why is your forehead all red?  Oh, gross!  Ah, the beauty of spring.  Stop! Appa, stop! Ugh!   I'm just glad we finally have another girl in the group, because you two are disgusting. So Toph, usually when setting up camp, we try to divide up the work. Well, actually what I'm trying to say is, some of us might fetch water, while someone else might set up the fire pit, or put up the tent. Even Momo does his fair share.  Well, that's great for you, but we still need to finish -  Never mind.  Hey Toph, I wanted to apologize for earlier. I think we're all just a little tired and getting on each other's nerves.  I meant all of us.  Good night. Should we leave? What is that thing? Actually, can you help us unload?  Well, yeah. That and everything else. You're a part of our team now, and -  That's not the point. Ever since you joined us, you've been nothing but selfish and unhelpful!  "Sugar queen">?!  D-did you just slam the door in my face?! How can you be so infuriating?! "Both"?! I'm completely calm!!>  The stars sure are beautiful tonight. Too bad you can't see them, Toph! Seriously, what is that thing?  That's good because Toph wasn't going to help anyway! It could be Zuko. We haven't seem him since the North Pole.  What's wrong with ponytails, Ponytail?  Well, it certainly tells the other warriors that you're fun and perky.  Let's get out of here.  It's those three girls from Omashu!  I can't believe those girls followed us all the way from Omashu. Are you kidding me? The crazy blue firebending and the flying daggers are bad enough, but last time we saw them, one of those girls did something that took my bending away. That's scary. Every time we land, those girls are there. So we'll just have to keep flying. I'm sure we'll come up with something after a short nap.   Of course, we could've gotten some sleep earlier, if Toph didn't have such issues.  I'm just saying. Maybe if you helped out earlier, we could have set up our camp faster and gotten some sleep and then maybe we wouldn't be in this situation!  No, I'm blaming her!  I know. We're all just trying to get used to each other. And I was so mean to her.  Thanks, Sokka. We need to find Toph and apologize. Are you sure he's okay to fly?  How did they find us? He's too tired!  Come on Appa, just a little further ...  You did it Appa!  Well, you know ...  Thanks. Zuko, I can help. Zuko! Why did they throw you in here? Oh, wait, let me guess. It's a trap. So that when Aang shows up to help me, you can finally have him in your little Fire Nation clutches!  You're a terrible person! You know that? Always following us! Hunting the Avatar! Trying to capture the world's last hope for peace! But what do you care? You're the Fire Lord's son. Spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood!  I don't? How dare you! You have no idea what this war has put me through! Me personally! The Fire Nation took my mother away from me. [ I'm sorry I yelled at you before. It's just that for so long now, whenever I would imagine the face of the enemy, it was your face. No, no, that's-that's not what I mean.  Maybe you could be free of it. I have healing abilities.  This is water from the Spirit Oasis at the North Pole. It has special properties, so I've been saving it for something important. I don't know if it would work, but ... Aang! Aang, I knew you would come.  We've got to find Sokka and Toph. I thought you had changed!   Sounds like you slept well.  Oh, no. Sokka, do you think the fog will delay the invasion? You made it, Dad!   Haru! It's so good to see you!  Wow, when he says the beginning he means the beginning beginning.  I don't see any gates.  Aang, I ... We've been through so many things together, and I've seen you grow up so much. You're not that little goofy kid I found in the iceberg anymore. I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm really proud of you. Yes, it is. Aang, don't say that, of course you'll-  What? Right, I'm on it.  Dad? How does that feel, dad? You're hurt, badly. You can't fight anymore. I'm doing everything I can. No offense Sokka, but you're not exactly Mr. Healing Hands. Don't be crazy Sokka. I still think you're crazy, but I'm proud of you too. Aang, stop it. You know Toph did all she could. She saved our lives. We're all concerned, but we can't afford to be fighting now. Aang, wait! We'd better start walking. We're the only people who know about the solar eclipse. We have to get that information to Ba Sing Se. Come on guys, we've got to stick together. Okay, but we've got to try to conserve it.  I'm sorry, it's all we have.  Sokka, wait! You shouldn't be eating strange plants!  I don't know ... Okay, I think you've had enough.  I don't think that's a good idea. Come on, we need to find Aang. What is that? Let's just keep moving. I hope Aang's okay ... I'm sorry, Aang. I know it's hard for you right now but ... we need to focus on getting out of here.  Come on, Aang. We can do this if we work together. Right Toph?  Sokka? Any ideas how to find Ba Sing Se?  Ugh ... We're getting out of this desert, and we're going to do it together! Aang, get up. Everybody, hold hands. We can do this. We have to. I think we should stop for the night. This is the last of it. Everyone can have a little drink. No, he hasn't. Sokka, let me see the things you got from the library. Sokka, I was there. No, but we can find out which way Ba Sing Se is. We can use the stars to guide us. That way we can travel at night when it's cool and rest during the day. Just try to get some sleep. We'll start again in a few hours. Come on, get up. We need to go. Well, we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit.  It's just a cloud. Wait! A cloud! Here, fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch.  Wow ... there's hardly any in here. Trying to keep everyone together. Let's just get moving. We need to head this direction. A boat‌? It's one of the gliders the sandbenders use! And look! It's got some kind of compass on it! I bet it can point us out of here! Aang, you can bend a breeze so we can sail it. We're going to make it! The needle on this compass doesn't seem to be pointing north according to my charts. That's what the compass is pointing to! That giant rock! It must be the magnetic center of the desert.  Maybe we can find some water there!  You've been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a cave‌?! Sokka, there's nothing there! We have to get out of here! I'm completely out of water to bend! Come on, we're going down. Toph, shoot a rock right there. Fire! Yes. Now let's move. On your left! We found the sailer abandoned in the desert. We're traveling with the Avatar. Our bison was stolen and we have to get to Ba Sing Se. Are you sure?‌  This should give us a good idea of what's around here.  I think we better keep moving.  I guess we could go check it out.   We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave. I think we need some new disguises.  "Flaming fire flakes", hot? What do you know? Aang, hold on! Where are we going? It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.  Uh. It can't hurt just to talk to him. I'm sure there's a good reason. Aang, that's great, but you should take it slow. Aang, you'll hurt yourself! But you're a great master. You have powers that I will never know. I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?  You'll have to eventually. It's okay, Aang. I'm healed. I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking! By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong. Aang, you're burned! Let me help you.  I guess I always knew.  He tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook.  Aang, what are you doing here? I thought you were looking for Appa. And also the complaining guy. His chi is blocked. Who did this to you?  Ty Lee. She doesn't look dangerous, but she knows the human body and its weak points. It's like she takes you down from the inside. Yes? They come to fix it!  Hi.  What's this "we" stuff? Aang and I are going to have to do all the work.  Grrr!  At this rate, we won't do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall. This is bad, really bad. So we just need to weaken the braces, instead of cutting all the way through. Wait. You need this water more than I do!  Slurry pipeline? What does that mean?  Why don't you try blocking my chi now, circus freak?  You know, I'm just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day! You're like a chattering hog-monkey! Toph, help me plug up this drain.  Enough with the Team Avatar stuff. No matter how many times you say it, it's not going to catch on.  Let's talk about this on our way into the city. Sokka ... One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll. Sokka, Long Feng is in control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.  Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.   Let's fly! We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the king that we're coming.  Sorry! Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King! You have to trust us. So you've never been outside the Upper Ring before? The Dai Li must've known we were coming and destroyed the evidence!  The wall. They'll never be able to cover that up in time.  Really? Then perhaps you could explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your "construction project".  It's a letter from your mom. Your mom's here in the city. And she wants to see you.  Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?  "A small fleet of Water Tribe ships."  "Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay. Led by Hakoda." It is Dad! And I can't believe we know where our dad is now. I hate to say it, but we have to split up. You have to meet this guru, Aang. If we're going to invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready. No, Sokka. I know how badly you wanna help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay. I'll stay here with the king. Easy there, big brother ... Though you're right. I am. What is it, Aang?  Wait. Aang.   Me too. Doesn't it seem kind of weird that we're hiding from the Fire Lord in his own house? What? How is that possible? Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves? Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.  Well, that's just silly. I don't sound like that.  Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on. Relax, Aang. They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time. What? Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?  You didn't really say that, did you? Does anyone know where Aang is? I'm gonna check outside. Are you all right? I know it's upsetting, but it sounds like you're overreacting. In where? What are you talking about? I didn't say that. An actor said that. Aang, I don't know. Because, we're in the middle of a war, and, we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time. Aang, I'm sorry, but right now I'm just a little confused. I just said I was confused! I'm going inside.  No kidding. I'm sorry. I'm just laughing at the irony. You know, how it would've been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago.  Maybe you're not as good as you think you are.  That's ridiculous.  Oh, yeah‌? What's your little form called‌?  Look!  Thanks, Aang. I love it.  So, how do I look?  Stop teasing him, Sokka. Aang's just a good friend. A sweet, little guy! Just like Momo.   Run downhill, then climb a tree!  Wow, it must be. That explains why you were so calm!  Maybe we should go see Aunt Wu and learn our fortunes. It could be fun. That proves it!   I guess you're not really getting wet then. Just admit you might be wrong, and you can come under the umbrella.  Really? Try to keep an open mind, Sokka. There are things in this world that just can't be explained. Wouldn't it be nice to have some insight into your future?  I guess that's me. Actually, I have this special seaweed lotion. I can get you some if you want. So, do you see anything interesting in my love line?   Tell me more! You're just saying that because you're going to make yourself unhappy your whole life.  Well, I liked my predictions. Certain things are going to turn out very well. Why? What did she tell you?  What's with the sky?  Shhh! She's coming!  Shhh! Hi, Aunt Wu! Sorry to bother you. About this man I'm supposed to marry ... Is he going to be handsome? Oh, I hope he's tall! Yes, please!  Wow, thanks, Aunt Wu. Oh wait, one more thing. How warmly should I dress tomorrow? Okay, okay, but one more thing.  Should I eat a mango or a papaya for breakfast tomorrow?  Aww, I hate papaya.  Hey, Aang.   Ugh, papaya please. Uh huh. Would you like some?  Okay then. See you later.  Can you believe she won't let me in? And after all the business I've given her? I know, but still ...  Sokka, you tried to convince me she was wrong before. It's going to take an awful lot to change my mind -  Oh no.  If you won't listen to him, maybe you'll listen to me. I want to believe Aunt Wu and her predictions as much as you do, but my brother and Aang saw the lava with their own eyes.  They just won't listen to reason.   I found it. The symbol for volcanic doom. It's too much! It's gonna overflow! Wait, what did you just say?  I suppose he is.  It's okay, Sokka. Everything's going to be all right.  Goodbye everyone! It was so nice to meet you! Take care, Meng. Um, aren't you forgetting the tarp? Sokka, you're supposed to put the tarp on top> of the tent. You know, so we don't get rained on?  But what if it does rain? You're infuriating!  Well, if you don't like my firewood-  Oh yeah? Well, you're Mister Lazy Bum, King of the Tents!  Sounds good.  Wow, I could just stare at it forever.  How can you not be fascinated Sokka? This is the largest canyon in the entire world. Ooh, canyon guide? Sounds informative. You're a refugee! Is that your tribe? Uh, one of them, I think.   Well Aang, ready to put your peace-making skills to the test?  Everybody listen up! This is the Avatar, and if you give him a chance, I'm sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy. He's the Avatar, Sokka, making peace between people is his job. Your arms, they're broken! You really think it'll rain? So it was you guys who had food!  Well, I guess it's okay if everyone's doing it. So, why does your tribe hate the Zhangs so much? I don't think so, Aang, the Zhangs really wronged the Gan Jins. They ambushed Jin Wei and stole the sacred orb. Not punished enough if you ask me. Oh no, that's a lot of canyon crawlers. Sokka, wait. I don't care about this stupid feud, I just want us to get out of here alive.  You did not! That is so wrong. Or we could send in Momo to do some damage! 'Cause, the ... sorry. I'll get these scrolls to him right away. Thank you, General How. What do you say, Momo? A cup of tea before we get back to the king? Table for two, please. Thank goodness you're here, Suki. Something terrible is going on. The Fire Nation has infiltrated the city, I just saw Prince Zuko and his uncle! We have to tell the Earth King right away!  Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes. I call the silk robe!   How do I look?  Oh, oh, yeah. I guess it's pretty obviously Water Tribe, isn't it?   Where have you been? We've been worried sick. Sapphire Fire. Nice to meet you. My goodness! That doesn't sound like our Kuzon.  Eh, if that's what you like ...   I don't know, Aang. These shoes aren't really right for dancing, and I-I'm not sure that I know how to-  Okay.  Aang, everyone's watching. We're safe Sokka, you can take off the mustache, now. Well, that was some dance party Aang.   Wow. We don't have buildings like this in the South Pole!  Wait, Aang! It could be dangerous if people find out you're the Avatar.  Technically, Aang is 112 years old.  Hi. June Pippinpaddleopsicopolis. Nice to meet you.  We will!  It sounded like fun at first, but now that I'm here, I'm starting to have second th-o-o-oughts!  Aang, do something! Use your airbending!  Is it just me, or is this guy's crown a little crooked?  You can't keep us here! Let us leave! This is a prison cell? But it's so nice.  We're not sticking around to find out. There's got to be some way out of here.  Well, no point arguing about it now. Get some rest, Aang. Looks like you'll need it for tomorrow. Other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body, doing great! Think about the challenges. Maybe it's some kind of riddle. We're going to keep trying, but that is a good back-up. And what did you learn?  And? Uh, over here! So this crazy king is your old friend Bumi?  Yeah, what's wrong with having a little fun in our down time?  All right, we'll finish our vacations and then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.   How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That sounds refreshing.  You've made a lot of trips into the desert.  I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka. It shouldn't be this hard to spot a giant, ornate building from the air.  Forget it. It's obviously not what we're looking for. The building in this drawing is enormous. You got something against libraries?  Oh, right. Sorry.  I have an authentic waterbending scroll.  Aang, did you know in a past life, you were left-handed? They destroyed everything having to do with the Fire Nation. Maybe these dials represent dates and times. Sokka, try entering that date from that parchment you took. Hey, wait. What happened to the sun? That makes sense. I mean, think what the lunar eclipse at the North Pole did to the waterbenders. This is huge.  He's sinking the building. We've gotta get out of here. Sokka, let's go. Don't be stupid! We'll find out later! But ...! Hurry, Sokka!  Just go!  Was it realistic? Is that how it was back then?  Do you think we'll really find airbenders?  Are you saying I'm a liar?  They really are airbenders! I don't know, Aang. That kid seemed pretty spirited.   Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so ... different.  I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.  You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temple's origins.  Hey, it's just like the one in the other temple!  Aang?  I've changed my mind. I think I was born without that something. No! Aaaaah! I can't believe I'm flying! Teo was right about the air. All I had to do was trust it, let it carry me. Wait! How do I land this thing? What if I land over a-ack-ack-bleck! Bug! Bug! Ack, that was a bug! Aang, what are we going to do? How can we possibly keep them all away? Ugh, if only we knew.  Huh, that's actually pretty smart.  Yes. But where's Sokka with the war balloon? Those things are unstoppable! Water? Can you get me close to one? Come on Sokka. Where's that war balloon?  No, Sokka! Hold on!  It looks like we'll need to go somewhere else to get food, assuming that'll fit into Sokka's master schedule. We're um ... from the Earth Kingdom colonies. Why do you guys live on the river?   Look at this place. It's so sad. We have to do something to help.  These people are starving! But you'd turn your back on them? How can you be so cold and heartless?  I guess so.   I wish I could help more.  Forty-three> minutes? No way! I think Appa's sick. It looks like he needs some medicine. Maybe we can find the right herbs in town. The Painted who now? Looks like we need to stay another night so Appa can rest. Can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady I mean ... spirit?  Why would you say that? Look how much better off these people are.  Well, hello Avatar. I wish I could talk, but I am very busy.  Thank you, but- A lot of people say that. Look, I really should get going.   Hi, Aang. I wasn't her at first, I was just trying to help the village. But since everyone thought that's who I was anyway, I guess I just kinda became her.  He might be sick of the purple berries I've been feeding him, but other than that he's fine! I'm sorry, I know I shouldn't have ... Well, if you wanna help, there's one more thing I have to do. Yes. Sokka was just kidding, but he was right. Getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently. Shhh! We don't wanna wake Sokka. Hi, Sokka, we were just out on a morning walk! I kind of destroyed their factory.  It was your idea! Well, what was I supposed to do?  No, I will never, ever turn my back on people who need me! I'm going down to that village, and I am gonna do whatever I can. I thought you didn't want to help. Sokka, you really do have a heart.  Leave this village and never come back. Sokka, it's okay. I shouldn't have acted like someone I wasn't, and I shouldn't have tricked you. But I felt like I had to do something. It doesn't matter if the Painted Lady is real or not. Because your problems are real, and this river is real. You can't wait around for someone to help you. You have to help yourself. So, Dock, are you gonna help us clean? You're looking at the only waterbender in the whole South Pole. This ship has haunted my tribe when Gran-Gran was a little girl. It was part of the Fire Nation's first attacks. I always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night. I'm making my own water! No, wait! I've got one! And this is a true Southern Water Tribe story. No, it happened to Mom. One winter when Mom was a girl, a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks. A month later, Mom noticed she hadn't seen her friend Nini since the storm. So Mom and some others went to check on Nini's family. When they got there, no one was home. Just a fire flickering in the fireplace. While the men went out to search, Mom stayed in the house. When she was alone, she heard a voice. "It's so cold and I can't get warm!" Mom turned and saw Nini standing by the fire. She was blue like she was frozen. Mom ran outside for help, but when everyone came back, Nini was gone. No one knows. Nini's house stands empty to this day, but sometimes, people see smoke coming up from the chimney, like little Nini is still trying to get warm. You're probably just jumpy from the ghost stories ... Thanks for letting us stay here tonight. You have a lovely inn. That Mr. Yao seems to have a thing for you. Maybe we should go back and see if he'll give us some free komodo sausages?  That's ridiculous. She's a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay. She kinda reminds me of Gran-Gran. Gee, I don't know. Maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night? Isn't that a little mysterious?  Sokka! Sokka, what are you doing? You can't just snoop around someone's house.  Sokka, you're gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude!  So she's got a hobby. There's nothing weird about that. Sokka, you've looked enough. Hama will be back soon.  Probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff!  Sokka, what are you doing? You're breaking into a private room! This is crazy! I'm leaving!  You're from the Southern Water Tribe? How did you know? I knew I felt a bond with you right away.  You're a waterbender! I've never met another waterbender from our tribe! We completely understand. We lost our mother in a raid. I can't tell you what it means to meet you. It's an honor. You're a hero. Yes! Yes, of course! To learn about my heritage, it would mean everything to me. I know! When we were stranded in the desert, I felt like there was almost nothing I could do. I've even used my own sweat for waterbending. Wow, these flowers are beautiful. I met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside. That was incredible! It's a shame about the lilies, though.  But isn't that dangerous? I thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon.  But ... to reach inside someone and control them? I don't know if I want that kind of power.  I know.  It's you ... You're the one who's been making people disappear during the full moons!  I won't! I won't use bloodbending and I won't allow you to keep terrorizing this town!   Stop! Please ...  You're not the only one who draws power from the moon! My bending is more powerful than yours, Hama. Your technique is useless on me!  I'm sorry, Aang!  No!  You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.  Maybe you should take your own advice, Toph! Oh, sorry. Did I splash you, Mud-Slug?  I'll give you a mud pie!  Very well, pupil. I believe we've had enough training for today.  Where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff? Ah, so she cheated. I'm just saying this isn't something we should make a habit of doing. I don't hate fun! See? Fun!  Guys, I think these scams have gone far enough. If you keep doing them, something bad is gonna happen.  Oh, I'm sorry! You think I should be more like you? Like some wild child?  Ah. I see. You're acting like this because of your parents. They were controlling over you, so you ran away, and now you act like your parents don't exist. You act like you hate them, but you don't. You just feel guilty. I don't think so. I think you miss them, but you just don't wanna deal with that, so instead you act like this crazy person. You know what? It doesn't matter. These scams put us all at risk, and we don't need that. We've already got some third-eyed freak after us.  We have enough money! You need to stop this! Sokka, tell me you didn't buy a bird.  Well. Look who decided to join us. Where have you two been? Off scamming again?  And I suppose you don't think what you're doing is dangerous at all? Really?  Well then. What's this?  It's a wanted poster of you! "The Runaway!" Is that what you're called now? Are you proud of this? It doesn't matter where I got it. The fact is- Your stuff was messy and I was just straightening up, and I happened to stumble across it!  Fine! It's a lie! But you've been so out of control lately, I knew something was up! I knew you were hiding something and you were! Don't you walk away from me while I'm talking to you! I wish I could! I never said I was! I don't act that way! Sokka, do I act motherly?  What do you think, Aang? Do I act like a mom?  Stop rubbing your eye and speak clearly when you talk! Well, I can't be around you! I know this is from you, Sokka! Toph can't write! Ugh! You're all driving me crazy!  Hi, Toph. Um, I wanna-  Actually I wasn't going to apologize. I was gonna say ... I wanna pull a scam with you.  Not just any scam. The ultimate scam. Whaddaya say, Toph? Just me and you. One last go. You in? The plan is simple: This wanted poster says you're worth a lot of money; Ten times more than you've made in all of your scams. So I'm gonna turn you in and collect the reward. Then you metalbend yourself out of jail, and we're on our way.   You brought this on yourself. I had no choice.  The right thing is its own reward.  But, I still want the actual reward.  Really? No kidding! Is that why we're sitting in a wooden cage right now? Gee, how'd you figure out it was a trap? I can't believe I'm so stupid! See? This is exactly why I'm against these scams! I knew this would happen! I know. I wanted to show that I'm not so motherly. I wanted to show you that I can have fun too. I know your relationship with your parents is complicated. And I shouldn't have said what I said. What are we gonna do? What about your meteor bracelet? You can make a saw. Just fine. I'm making my own water. Aang, get up!   What is it, Toph?  I'll be happy to help.  Waterbending bomb! Yeah!  Sorry.   Shush up about Appa. Can't you at least try to be sensitive?  Oh ... well, okay. I'm glad you're doing better. Great! We can travel through the Serpent's Pass together. Hmm ... peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass? I can't believe how many people's lives have been uprooted by the Fire Nation. You look so different without your makeup! And the new outfit. Appa is missing. We hope to find him in Ba Sing Se. It says, "abandon hope". What are you talking about? Okay, if you say so. You know, it's okay to miss Appa. What's going on with you? In the desert, all you cared about was finding Appa and now it's like you don't care about him at all. But now you're not letting yourself feel anything. I know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care. But you have to promise me that you won't stop caring. Come on, you need a hug. Everyone single file! Aang, I need help!  What is that thing? Sokka! Sokka, calm down. I helped Gran-Gran deliver lots of babies back home. It's called a baby and I helped her deliver plenty of those, too. Aang, get some rags. Sokka, water. Toph, I need you to make an earth tent, a big one. Suki, come with me. You're doing great, Ying. Sokka, where's that water? Now get ready to push. One ... two ... ... three, push!  It's a girl! Aang, you have to come see this. She's beautiful. You'll find him, Aang. Sokka ... Aang! What happened? I've always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night.  The Avatar is the bridge between our world and the Spirit World! Aang can talk to them! The only problem is, last time you got to the Spirit World by accident. How are you going to get there this time?  It's so warm here! How is that possible? He's meditating, trying to cross over into the Spirit World. It takes all his concentration. He's crossing into the Spirit World. He'll be fine as long as we don't move his body. That's his way back to the physical world.  No, he's my friend. I'm perfectly capable of protecting him.  No ... Aang!  He took Aang. He took him right out from under me.  I can't believe I lost him. Okay. It's all right. You stay here, Momo, in case Aang comes back. I'm not worried they'll get away in the blizzard. I'm worried that they won't. Look, that's gotta be Aang! Yip-yip!  Trust me Zuko, it's not going to be much of a match. It's too late, it's dead. What about Aang? He still needs to learn waterbending. You too, Momo.  Aang, I know you're excited, but it's been a hundred years since you've been home.  It's just that ... a lot can change in all that time.  Aang, before we get to the temple, I want to talk to you about the airbenders.  Well, I just want you to be prepared for what you might see. The Fire Nation is ruthless. They killed my mother, and they could have done the same to your people.  I know it's hard to accept. Aang, it's amazing!  You're lucky enough to be one of the first outsiders to ever visit an airbender temple, and all you can think about is food? What's wrong? Fire Nation.  Aang! There's something you need to see.  Uh ... Just a new waterbending move I learned. I can for Aang's sake. If he finds out that the Fire Nation invaded his home, he'll be devastated.  You must miss him.  Where are you going? But Aang, no one could have survived in there for a hundred years.  Good point. Who are all these people?  And this one's a waterbender. They're lined up in a pattern: air, water, earth and fire.  Of course. They're Avatars. All these people are your past lives, Aang. It's true. When the Avatar dies, he's reincarnated into the next nation in the cycle. Aang! Snap out of it!  Who is that?  There's no writing. How do you know his name?  You're making a sound!  Aang!  What happened? Oh no! It's his Avatar Spirit! He must have triggered it! I'm going to try and calm him down!   Aang! I know you're upset and I know how hard it is to lose the people you love. I went through the same thing when I lost my mom. Monk Gyatso and the other airbenders may be gone, but you still have a family. Sokka and I! We're your family now! It's okay. It wasn't your fault. Everything's packed. You ready to go? Maybe you'll find a way.  What are you going to name him?  What are you doing? Okay, I'm not crushed. You can get off me now! Aang, there's no way we can fly out of here.  No! The Fire Nation can't separate our family again!  Ha, ha.  Yeah, no kidding.   Oh, everyone trusts you now! I was the first person to trust you! Remember, back in Ba Sing Se. And you turned around and betrayed me, betrayed all of us!  You really want to know? Hmm, maybe you could reconquer Ba Sing Se in the name of the Earth King. Or, I know! You could bring my mother back!  You look terrible.  What do you want? I need to borrow Appa. Yes, it is. We're going to find the man who took my mother from me.  Ugh, I knew you wouldn't understand.   Fine, maybe it is! Maybe that's what I need! Maybe that's what he deserves! It's not the same! Jet attacked the innocent. This man, he's a monster. Then you didn't love her the way I did! Now that I know he's out there ... now that I know we can find him, I feel like I have no choice. It's not just hard, it's impossible.  Yes. Don't try to stop us. Thanks for understanding, Aang. Yip-yip.   So once we find the communication tower, we bust in and take the information we need.  Whaletail Island, here we come. Oh, don't you worry about my strength. I have plenty. I'm not the helpless little girl I was when they came.  I ran as fast as I could. But we were too late. When we got there, the man was gone. And so was she.  I know.  Let's do this. It's not him. He's not the man. That was him. That was the monster. Do you know who I am? Oh, you better remember me like your life depends on it! Why don't you take a closer look?  She lied to you! She was protecting the last waterbender!  Me!  I always wondered what kind of person could do such a thing, but now that I see you, I think I understand. There's just nothing inside you, nothing at all. You're pathetic and sad and empty. But as much as I hate you ... I just can't do it. I'm doing fine. I wanted to do it. I wanted to take out all my anger at him, but I couldn't. I don't know if it's because I'm too weak to do it or because I'm strong enough not to.  But I didn't forgive him. I'll never forgive him. But I am ready to forgive you.  We need you, Aang.  Are you all right, Aang? You seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately. You want to tell me about it?  Well, we better smoothly fly ourselves to a market, 'cause we're out of food.  What happened in your dream?  I don't know if I like the sound of that swishing.  I just realized we're out of money anyway. You could get a job, smart guy. That's right.  Don't yell at him! Aang would never turn his back on anyone. Aang is the bravest person I know. He's done nothing but help people and save lives since I met him. It's not his fault he disappeared, right Aang? Aang, what's wrong? You're a horrible old man! Appa, yip yip! It's okay. That fisherman was way out of line.  What do you mean? It has to do with your dream, doesn't it? Talk to me. I'm going to try to get a little fire going. So you were upset that you were the Avatar? Why wouldn't you be excited about it? That's awful, Aang. I don't know what to say. Whoa! Hot cinders! You have the right to be angry after the monks sent you away like that. You ran away. You don't know what would have-. Aang ... You're being too hard on yourself, even if you did run away. I think it was meant to be. If you had stayed, you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders. I know it was meant to be this way. The world needs you now. You give people hope.  It's okay. You're safe. What do you mean? Where's Sokka? I'm going with you! Where are they? Really? I don't think you're gonna have those nightmares anymore.  Is something wrong? I don't know. There's something ominous about that place.  Sokka, you've got an elbow leech.  Where do you think? You couldn't find them? Maybe you should listen to Aang. Something about this place feels ... alive.>  Appa! Momo! What was that? Does anyone else get the feeling that we're being watched?  Aang! Sokka! Hello? Hello? Can you help me? Mom? Mom! I can't believe ...  Well, I've been wandering around looking for you! What girl? I thought I saw Mom.  You saw something too? Okay ... so where's here? The middle of the swamp? So, who are you then?  But what did our visions mean? Hey, you guys are waterbenders!  The South Pole. No, it's all ice and snow. What about the visions? Toph! Aren't you gonna get ready for the day? You're not gonna wash up? You've got a little dirt on your ... everywhere, actually. Hmm ... You know what we need? A girl's day out! It'll be fun! Are you ready for some serious pampering? I'm glad. It's about time we did something fun together. Don't listen to them, let's just keep walking.  Let's go, Toph. Now that was funny. Those girls don't know what they're talking about. That's what I really admire about you, Toph. You're so strong, and confident, and self-assured. And I know it doesn't matter, but ... You're really pretty. Yeah, you are. Ow!  That's great, Aang.  That's great!  What does me being a girl have to do with sewing?  All done with your pants! And look what a great job I did!  He's right. At this rate, we won't get to the North Pole until spring.  Whooh!  He looks pretty good out there.  No, Appa. Don't eat that!   What's wrong? Get out of there! What was that thing?  No, don't hurt him! He didn't mean it. My brother is just an idiot sometimes.   Aang ... do some airbending.  Well, maybe just a bite.  He's just upset because a bunch of girls kicked his butt yesterday.  Right. And then they kicked your butt. Hey, don't get too comfortable. It's risky for us to stay in one place for very long. Well, it's nice to see you excited about being the Avatar. I just hope it doesn't all go to your head.  Oh, good! Can you help me carry this back to the room? It's a little heavy.  What do you mean, "you can't?"  Watching you show off for a bunch of girls does not sound like fun.  It's not my basket. These supplies are for our trip. I told you, we have to leave Kyoshi soon.  Aangy ...  "Simple monk", huh? I thought you promised me that this Avatar stuff wouldn't go to your head.  Jealous? Of what?  That's ridiculous.  Urch!  Yeah.  Good for you.  Nope. Have fun.  Great.  I'm glad you know.  Good!   I wanted to make sure you were safe. You really had me worried.  I'm sorry.  Well, get out of the water before you catch a cold, you big jerk!  Hang on, Aang! Aang!  Zuko!  Wake up, Aang! Get inside. It's not your fault. Then let's get out of here. Zuko will leave Kyoshi to follow us. I know it feels wrong to run, but I think it's the only way.  I know it's hard, but you did the right thing. Zuko would have destroyed the whole place if we had stayed. They're going to be okay, Aang.  What are you doing?  Yes, it was.  Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight. They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!  The Northern Water Tribe.  I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here! This place is beautiful.  Ha, prince of what?  My apologies, Prince Sokka. Very smooth ...  I've waited for this day my whole life. I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!  What do you mean you won't teach me? I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me no! But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe! I don't want to heal, I want to fight!  Well, your rules stink! Wait! Aang didn't mean that! You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku, even if he is a big jerk. Uhhh ... Hi. Are you Yagoda?  I guess I am. Thanks for the lesson. Huh?  Ah ... No. I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace and my mother passed it down to me.  Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name? She never told me. If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave? How's warrior training going?   Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach me whatever moves you learn from Master Pakku! That way, you have someone to practice with, and I get to learn waterbending! Everyone's happy! But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.  I got it! That wasn't me. Yes ... please! Fine. No. No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!  I'll be outside if you're man enough to fight me.  I know! I don't care! I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy! So, you decided to show up? Aren't you going to fight?  You can't knock me down! But you still won't teach me, will you? Come back here. I'm not finished yet! No, it's not. It's mine! Give it back!  My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you? But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage. Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage. You, too.  Calm down, it's going to be okay. If you want, I can try to teach you some of the stuff I know.  We'll need to find a good source of water first.  Remember the reason we're here. This is a pretty basic move, but it still took me months to perfect. So don't get frustrated if you don't get it right away. Just push and pull the water like this. The key is getting the wrist movement right.  That's almost right. If you keep practicing I'm sure eventually—  Wow, I can't believe you got that so quickly. It took me two months to learn that move.  Thanks. This is a more difficult move. I call it streaming the water. It's harder than it looks, so don't be disappointed if- Nice work. Though the over-the-head flare was unnecessary.  Well I kind of know this one other move, but it's pretty hard. I haven't even totally figured it out yet. The idea is to create a big, powerful wave.   That's enough practicing for today. No offense Aang, but I'll hold the money from now on.   Look at this, Aang. It's a waterbending scroll! Check out these crazy moves. So, how much for the, uh, traded scroll?  Aang, can we get out of here? I feel like we're getting weird looks.  I'll just feel a lot better once we get away from here.  I don't think these pirates are here to trade with us.  Aang! I thought we were running away from the pirates!   I know. That's why I took this.   Isn't it great?  I prefer to think of it as high risk trading. Sokka, where do you think they got it? They stole it from a waterbender! These are real waterbending forms. You know how crucial it is for Aang to learn waterbending! I just want to try this one move first and then it's all yours. Here, hold it open for me. The single water whip. Looks doable. Ow!  What's so funny?  Aang will get his turn once I figure out the water whip. Ugh, why can't I get this stupid move?  Will you please shut your air hole? Believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes! Why don't we just throw the scroll away since you're so naturally gifted! What? Oh my gosh, Aang, I am so sorry, I don't know what came over me. But you know what, it won't happen again. Here, this is yours. I don't want to have anything to do with it anymore.  I'm sorry, Momo. No more apologies!  Shhh, Momo! Go back to sleep. Shh! Ugh, ugh, ugh! Shoot! Come on water, work with me here! Okay, what if I just, ow! Stupid scroll! Okay Katara, shift your weight through the stances. No! Let go of me!   Go jump in the river! My mother's necklace! How did you get that? No! Aang, this is all my fault. Thanks, Momo. I owe you a bushel of apples.  Help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here.  Everybody in! I couldn't have done it without your help.  Aang, look!  We can stop the boat! Aang, together, push and pull the water! It's working, it's slowing down! We're doing it! Aang, I still owe you an apology. You were just so good at waterbending without really trying. I got so competitive that I put us all in danger, I'm sorry. Besides, who needs that stupid scroll anyway? The scroll! Stealing is wrong. Unless it's from pirates. This is humiliating.  Both. Uhhh ... I think your feet need their eyes checked. You guys go. I think we need to talk about some things. We need to decide what we're gonna do now, and since you're the Avatar, maybe you should be a part of this. Aang, no one said it's going to be easy. We could look for Jeong Jeong! Aang, can we talk about you learning firebending now? You can't possibly think that any of us would trust you, can you? I mean, how stupid do you think we are?! Or when you stole my mother's necklace and used it to track us down and capture us? You need to get out of here. Now. No, we won't! Get out of here, and don't come back! And if we ever see you again, well, we'd better not see you again! Why would he try to fool us like that? This is just like when we were in prison together at Ba Sing Se. He starts talking about his mother and making it seem like he's an actual human being with feelings. The thing is, it worked. I did feel sorry for him. I felt like he was really confused and hurt, but obviously, when the time came, he made his choice, and we paid the price. We can't trust him. Sokka, I looked at it, and I told you, there was nothing there! No way! I'm sure he only did it so he could capture you himself! And what was all that crazy stuff about setting Appa free? What a liar!  You're right, Toph! Let's go find him and give him a medal. The "not as much of a jerk as you could have been" award! Easy for you to say! You weren't there when he had us attacked by pirates! Why would you even try to defend him? Well, I guess that settles that.  Has anyone seen Toph? I think we should go look for her.  Toph! What happened? Oh no, what happened? I meant, how. Zuko? It's gonna take a while for your feet to get better. I wish I could have worked on them sooner.  You are a master of surprise, Sokka ... I can't step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and I can't get a good enough angle on him from down here.  I'll go along with whatever you think is right.  You might have everyone else here buying your ... transformation, but you and I both know you've struggled with doing the right thing in the past. So let me tell you something, right now. You make one step backward, one slip-up, give me one reason to think you might hurt Aang, and you won't have to worry about your destiny anymore. Because I'll make sure your destiny ends ... right then and there. Permanently.  Those clouds look so soft, don't they? Like you could just jump down and you'd land in a big, soft, cottony heap?  You're hilarious. Hey, what is that? Aang? Are you okay? Shhh! Aang, you didn't let this happen. It has nothing to do with you. That's why we're going to the North Pole. To find you a teacher.  Hey, Aang! You ready to be cheered up? These acorns are everywhere, Aang. That means the forest will grow back! Every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday, and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back.  What happens then? Hey great bridge guy, could I talk to you over here for a second? Aang, you seem a little unsure about all of this. So ... can you help these people?  I think you can do it, Aang. Aang will figure out the right thing to do, Sokka.  Sokka, wait!   Sokka!  I know. Everything's going to be okay ...  It's okay, Appa, don't worry. I'm sure they're on their way back. I bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat.  It's no use, Appa. I don't seem them anywhere. Our best hope is to go back to the village and wait.  You're back! Where's Sokka? Aang, what are you doing?! Run! Sokka!  You were trapped in the Spirit World for 24 hours! How are you feeling? Sokka! I'm so proud of you, Aang. You figured out what to do, all on your own. That's great! But the solstice is tomorrow!  Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford to lose you to the Fire Nation. Neither can I. We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.  Aang. We've got trouble!  Fireball!  We have to get out of Zuko's range, before he shoots another hot stinker at us! There's no time! And that's exactly why we're here.  Aww, you must be tired.  I was talking to Appa.  The Fire Nation must have abandoned the temple when Avatar Roku died. That's when we were at the Air Temple. Avatar Roku's eyes were glowing there, too!  Can't you just open them with firebending? Like you opened that other door?  You've really outdone yourself this time, Sokka.  It's almost sunset. Are you ready?  Aang! Stop! There's nothing else we can do ...  Sokka, you're a genius! You're right. Sokka's plan didn't work. But it looks like it did.  Aang! Now's your chance!  Go!  He made it!  How's Aang gonna make it out of this?  No! Aang! Not without Aang! [ Walking away with Sokka, helping Aang.>] I don't know.  What are you doing in my mouth? Momo, you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries.  Come on! Come on! Come on!  Wait, my boomerang!  Oh, I see, so there's time to get your scrolls and time to get your staff, but no time for my boomerang?  Oh.  I feel like I've lost part of my identity. Imagine if you lost your arrow, or Katara lost her ... hair loopies.  I used to be boomerang guy ... And here comes Avatar Roku!  And it's nice to appreciate their deep-fried festival food!  Now a torch, that's a nice prop. It's bright, dangerous ... smells manly. But I'm not sure I could carry it off. So some people don't like you, big deal! There's a whole nation of firebenders who hate you. Now let's bust you out of here!  Sure you can! A little swish-swish-swish! Airbending slice! And we're on our way! How're we gonna to do that? The crime happened over three hundred years ago.  Well, I guess I could be classified as such.  Everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard, but I figured out it was Old Man Jarko wearing polar leopard boots! See, a real eight hundred-pound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks. Okay, I guess I am pretty good.  Fine! But I'm going to need some new props. I'm ready. What? This temple and this statue were cut from the same stone. And we know that the statue was built after Chin died.  Shhh! I wanna solve it! That means Kyoshi never set foot in this temple! You're right. We need to go to Kyoshi Island. They say it was Kyoshi.  So, uh ... what's Suki up to? Is she around?  Oh, well ... that's great. These fans ... They were her weapons, no?  Special outfit? Hat and pipe? These things mean anything to you?  Aha! There's no way Kyoshi could have made that footprint. And therefore there is nothing linking her to the crime scene.  Three hundred and seventy years? Wait, are you sure it was today?  This ceremony didn't take place at sunrise. It took place at sunset. Look at the shadows.  If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset, she couldn't have been in Chin committing the crime. She has an alibi!   You can do it, Aang. Just remember the evidence.  The footprint!  He's dead.  What are you doing?  I do believe in the power of stuff.  Boomerang! You do always come back!  What is this?  This is by far the worst town we've ever been to. Let me see that. This is a Water Tribe weapon. See if you can find anything else. It's burned. There was a battle! Water Tribe warriors ambushed a group of firebenders. The firebenders fought back, but the warriors drove them down this hill.  I don't know. The trail ends here.  It's one of our boats! No, but it's from his fleet. Dad was here.  I'm coming with you.  I'm strong, I'm brave, I can fight! Please, Dad! I don't understand.   Who's there?   Bato?  Where's Dad? What smells so good, Bato? Perfume? Maybe we can dump some on Appa, because he stinks so much. Am I right?  Everything's here, even the pelts! Dad could eat a whole barrel of these things!  So, who was it that came up with the Great Blubber Fiasco?  It's a long one Aang, some other time. Was it you or Dad that put an octopus on your head and convinced Gran-Gran you were a water spirit?  When? It's been over two years since we've seen Dad. That would be so incredible! Katara! It would be great, but we can't. We have to take Aang to the North Pole first.  Is this the boat he took you ice dodging in? How are we supposed to ice dodge without ice?  Aang, ease up on the jib. Katara, steady. Aang, less sail. Katara, give him room. Aang, helm to lee. Helm to lee! Great job! We can make it. Aang, I'm gonna need air in that sail. Katara, I want you to bend as much water as you can between us and those rocks. Now!  This is the map to our father! You had it the whole time? How could you? Well, you can go to the North Pole on your own. I'm going to find Dad.   Katara, are you with me? It's probably wounded. We need to go back. I wanna see Dad, but, helping Aang is where we're needed the most. Thanks, Bato. We split up. He's long gone. Pretty stupid. Run! I'm ... starting to get some feeling back! Ow. That thing sees with its nose. Let's give him something to look at. Yeah, we've lost too much time as it is. Of course we do, Aang. But, you're our family, too. And right now, you need us more.  Rock beats airbender! You're awfully cute, but unfortunately you're made of meat. Just a bit closer ... Gotcha! You are one lucky little meat creature. You probably think I deserve this, don't you? Look, I'm sorry I hunted you, but that's just the natural order of things. Big things eat smaller things, nothing personal. But this time it didn't work out that way. I admit it ... you're cute. Okay, you convinced me, if I get out of this alive, it's a karmically correct, vegetarian existence for me. No meat. Even though meat is so tasty. Hey, looks like my karma is already paying off! That's okay, I got it. Now, come back boomerang. Okay, karma person or thing, whoever's in charge of this stuff. If I can just get out of this situation alive, I will give up meat and sarcasm. Okay? Ow! That's all I got. It's pretty much my whole identity. Sokka, the meat and sarcasm guy. But I'm willing to be Sokka, the veggies and straight talk fellow. Deal? Aang! Thank goodness! Have you got any meat? Aggh, stop, stop! You're going to pull my fingers off and I don't think the rest of me is coming! Seriously Aang, I know you're new at it, but I could use a little earthbending here. How about it? Well, if you can't earthbend me out of here, go get Toph. You can't? Why not? Uncomfortable? Well, I wouldn't want you to feel uncomfortable ... Awkward position, I think I know the feeling. Hmmm ... how about that. Aang, this is my friend, Foo Foo Cuddlypoops. Foo Foo Cuddlypoops, Aang. Really? He looks nothing like a saber-tooth moose-lion. Aang, this is bad, you've got to get me out of here! This is really bad! Please Aang, you have to earthbend me out, there's no other way! Please, don't leave me again. What are you doing here?  Awww, this is a really wonderful, touching moment. So could you get me out of here so I can give you both a big, snuggly hug? Yeah, no crushing, please. The whole time, I was in that hole, not knowing if I was going to live or die. It makes a man to think about what's really important. I realized–  Hey, don't jinx it! We can still be attacked by some giant exploding Fire Nation spoon. Or find out the city's been submerged in an ocean full of killer shrimp! I'm just sayin', weird stuff happens to us.  He's a giant bison! Where could someone possibly hide him?  Oh.  What's the problem? It's amazing! Yes. We have information about the Fire Nation army that we need to deliver to the Earth King, immediately.  Ugh! Maybe you missed what I said. We need to talk to the king about the War, it's important. Yeah, we met a professor from the Ba Sing Se University. He took us to an ancient underground library where we discovered information about the war that is absolutely crucial for the Earth King to hear>! Is that woman deaf? She only seems to hear every other word I say. And who're the mean-looking guys in robes?  A month?  I think we would enjoy it more if we weren't staying for so long. Can't we see the Earth King any sooner?  Where's the black market? Who runs it? Come on, you know!  Right. And which of your professors could we ask about the war with the Fire Nation?  Hey, come with me. So, Pong, what's goin' on with this city? Why is everyone here so scared here to talk about the war?  Certainly you mean his pet skunk bear.  Aha, but you learned it! You could teach us!  Avatar Aang, how do you do? Go on. But I feel so fancy!   Fire! Look, I came up with a back-up plan. We dress Momo like a ghost, okay? He flies by the guards, creating a distraction. Then, we blast a hole in the wall- Okay ... But remember that Momo ghost plan. I think it's a winner.  Forget about them! Just keep an eye out for the king.  You know, royal, flowing robe, fancy jewelry.   Thanks for letting us in!  What guy? Not until we see the king.  You keep their attention while I look for the king. Aang! The Earth King! Hey, let me go! Why won't you let us talk to the king? We have information that could defeat the Fire Nation!  But we found out about a solar eclipse that will leave the Fire Nation defenseless. You could lead an invasion ...  We've got a few options. First; round nuts. And some kind of oval shaped nuts? And some rock-shaped nuts, that might just be rocks. Dig in!  What was that?  Shouldn't we run away from huge booms? Not toward them? He looks dangerous, so we better approach cautiously.  Hey! I worked hard to get those nuts! Yeah, I hate 'em too.   Fire Nation! Act natural!  Nice guy. How long has the Fire Nation been here? Everyone should get some sleep, we're leaving at dawn.  Absolutely not! This village is crawling with Fire Nation troops. If they discover you're here, Aang, we'll be eating fireballs for breakfast. Goodnight.  Goodnight!>  Slow down, Katara. When did this happen? Then it's too late to track him, he's long gone. I thought you were crazy at first, Katara, but this might work. There are ventilation shafts throughout these mines. All Aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here. The boulder levitates and ta-da!> Fake earthbending. Do you remember your cue?  By this,> do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders?  Here they come! Get in your places!  Get out of my way, pipsqueak!   What did you call me?  You better back off! Seriously, back off. That's it! You're going down!  No, you idiot, it's the girl! I'll hold her. You've got twelve hours to find Haru. We'll be right behind you.  Momo, you have some big ears!   She'll be fine, Aang. Katara knows what she's doing. Your twelve hours are up; where's Haru? We've gotta get outta here!  We don't have much time. There are guards everywhere. Get on! What do you mean you're not leaving? I say you're both crazy! Last chance! We need to leave, now!  I hate when you get like this. Come on, we better hide. We don't have much time. What are we gonna do? Wouldn't he just take his keys with him? For that they'd need some kind of earth, or some rock. Something they can bend. It should. These vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village. We're gonna do the same thing, but on a much bigger scale. There's a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo. And the whole system is ventilated. Aang closed off all the vents except one. When he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go, right back here. Stay back! I'm warning you!  This is gonna take forever.  These are Fire Nation traps, you can tell from the metalwork. We better pack up camp, and get moving. Uh uh. No flying this time.  Think about it: Somehow Prince Zuko and the Fire Nation keep finding us. It's because they spot Appa, he's just too noticeable.  He's a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head! It's kinda hard to miss him!   I know you all wanna fly, but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk.  I'm not the boss, I'm the leader.  I'm the oldest, and I'm a warrior, so I'm the leader! Are you kidding, he's just a goofy kid!  I've kissed a girl, you just haven't met her.  No! Besides Gran-Gran. Look, my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot, and a leader has to trust his instincts.  Ha, ha, very funny. Okay, okay, I get it. Look guys, I'm tired too. But the important thing is that we're safe from the Fire ... Nation. Run! We're cut off! If you let us pass, we promise not to hurt you.  Bluffing? Uh, instinct? Hey, he was mine!  Man!  Army? There were only like, twenty guys. Where? There's nothing here.  Why? What's this do?   Yeah, nothing's braver than a guy in a tree house. Unfortunately, we have to leave tonight.  What mission? Shh ... It amplifies vibrations.  Nothing yet. Wait! Yes, someone's approaching. I think there's just one.  Wait, false alarm ... He's just an old man. Jet, he's just an old man! But he's not hurting anyone! This doesn't feel right. Yeah he's back. But we're leaving. Your boyfriend Jet's a thug. He's messed up Katara. He beat and robbed a harmless old man! Fine! But even if he was Fire Nation, he was a harmless civilian! I didn't see any knife! There was no knife! I'm going back to the hut and packing my things.  I'm sorry Katara. Jet's very smooth, but we can't trust him. Katara, I'm not jealous of Jet. It's just that my instinct— I heard your plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom town. There are people living there, Jet; mothers and fathers and children. You lied to Aang and Katara about the forest fire! I do understand. I understand that there's nothing you won't do to get what you want. You can't do this! How can you stand by and do nothing while Jet wipes out a whole town? If that's how Jet leads, then he's got a lot to learn.  While you two are up there, you might want to practice your knot work.  It will be safe, without you.  I warned the villagers of your plan, just in time.  At first they didn't believe me. The Fire Nation soldiers assumed I was a spy. But one man vouched for me, the old man you attacked. He urged them to trust me, and we got everyone out in time.  Who would be free? Everyone would be dead. No, Jet. You became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people. Yip yip.   Hey, sometimes they're right. And sometimes they're wrong.  Hey, I thought designing the lost Appa poster was my job. I've been working all day on my Appa!   This is his head.   Those are his horns. I haven't seen him in a while, okay? Thank you, I worked really- Why do you feel the need to do that?  What happened to you? Did the Dai Li throw you in jail? We can't wait around to get permission for everything. That might come back to bite us in the blubber. We'll split up to cover more area. Toph, I guess you should just come with me. Katara, what is it? But we don't even know why he's here! How can you tell?  Far, very far. Here it is. It's near the South Pole, almost all the way back home. All right, let's get moving. We can take the train out to the wall but then we'll have to walk. No it's not! Toph can't tell who's lying because they both think they're telling the truth. Jet's been brainwashed!  Maybe Katara should kiss him. That should bring something back! Hey, just an idea! Ooh, wait! I've got it! Wait! Remember what Joo Dee said? She said she went on vacation to Lake Laogai! So where's this secret headquarters? Now that's something different. If we keep moving, maybe we can catch up with them! You think we can outrun them? Yeah! Appa!  This is it! The official rendezvous point for the invasion force. Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on the map. It's uninhabited, and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.  Whatever. That's like four days from now. Let's just calm down and- That's okay, Aang. The eclipse will block off firebending anyway. You don't need to know it. Plus, it's a stupid element. What? Who's talking? What? But that was just a dream. I'm a great climber! Stupid Avatar! Stupid cliff! Stupid dream! I can climb fast!  Of course you are. That's 'cause you gotta fight the Fire Lord, the baddest man on the planet. And you better win or we're all done for.  What? It's true. That's the deal. He knows it.  Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.  Tell me more about this "Fire Lord". Why are you so afraid of him?  Life does feel that way sometimes, doesn't it? Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.  Want to try screaming into this pillow? Then our work here is done. Looks like it's time for another ... therapy session. Hey! I'm tryin' build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison. You've been awake too long.  About what? We made it for you. A good night's sleep will probably take the crazy away. We hope. We all do. You can do this. You're ready. Up until now it was. Now Ba Sing Se is the only great Earth Kingdom stronghold left. Aang, stop. We don't even know if Bumi's still ...  A-around. A secret passage? Why didn't we just use this last time? Ugh! Eww!  Ahh! They won't let go! Help!  Oh, it's so awful. I'm dying. Where would they be keeping him? Suckers! You're all about to come down with a nasty case of pentapox. The marks make ya look sick, but you gotta act sick too. Ya gotta sell it!  Now that's what I'm talkin' about. Okay everyone! Into sick formation. No! Bad Fire Nation baby!  Oh ... all right. You realize we're probably walking right into a trap.  Way ahead of ya!   I seem to manage!  We can catch him! Kind of makes you realize how insignificant we are. Oh man, you've never >not seen anything like this. What should I do? So what, I'm just a lemur sitter? There, there, feel better?  Right. Staying clear, got it.  Boo-hoo, poor heroes.  It's just, all you guys can do this awesome bending stuff like putting out forest fires, and flying around and making other stuff fly around. I can't fly around, okay? I can't do anything. Look, I appreciate the effort, but the fact is each of you is so amazing and so special and I'm ... not. I'm just the guy in the group who's regular.  You do? Shopping! Maybe a little something to reinvigorate my battling. Hey, how about these?   Ooh! That's> what Sokka's talking about. A sword?  It would be nice to be a master sword fighter. All right, I'll talk to him. I've come to train with the master.  Well, uhh ...  Master, my name is Sokka, and I wish to be instructed in the way of the sword.  Oh, uh, really, uh where I come from, the Fire Nation colonies, it's a pretty normal name... for Fire Nation colonials.  Well, actually, I've been all over the world.  And I know one thing for sure: I have a lot to learn.  I know. Your butler told me that when I met you, I would have to prove my worth. But the truth is... I don't know if I am worthy.  Like a second head.  Writing my name will make me a better swordsman‌?  I am? I am! So this is about putting my identity on the page, right? I'm finished!  Is that ok‌ay? Hm, manipulate them to my advantage ... oh! Hey, would you mind grabbing a cold drink for me‌?  I have‌? But I thought I messed up every single thing we worked on!  Are you giving me one of yours‌? Master, would it be possible for me to leave and bring back a special material for my sword‌? Hey, guys. What are you doing‌?  Funny how‌?  What's their deal‌?  Thanks. That warms my heart. Anyway, I need some help.  Oh, these are my friends. Just other good Fire Nation folks. Do you think we can make a sword out of a meteorite‌? I'm sorry, Master. You're wrong. I am not worthy. I'm not who you think I am. I'm not from the Fire Nation. I'm from the Southern Water Tribe. I lied so that I could learn swordsmanship from you. I'm sorry.  No, this is my fight, alone. It's a Pai Sho tile.  I have no idea. Ooh, that reminds me! Toph, I thought you might like this since you've probably never had a chance to bend space earth before. Must you ruin everything‌?  Hey, I remember her! She helped you attack us!  What do you mean Aang doesn't exist? Do you mean he's ... you know, dead? You saved your uncle's sweaty sandal? Ugh!   Welcome to the family, Gramp-Gramp!  How about Grand-Pakku?  Master Piandao.  He's gone. And so is Aang. So, Bumi ... how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?  No, not really. What about us? What's our destiny today?  I think that, even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do everything we can to stop the airship fleet.  Thank you, Master. Toph, metalbend the rudder so it's jammed in a turning position. The ship will spiral and slam into the others. Have I ever mentioned how sweet it is that you invented metalbending?  My leg! Hang on Toph!  Bye, space sword. I don't think boomerang's coming back, Toph. It looks like this is the end.   No, Suki did.  You did it! You should've seen yourself, it was amazing! You were all like and the Fire Lord was all like  Well, look at you, buster. Now that your firebending's gone I guess we should call you the Loser Lord. There's my favorite warriors! I have to admit, I kind of missed the face paint. So how does it feel to be in uniform again?  Careful, Suki! Ty Lee is pretending to be a Kyoshi Warrior again. Zuko, stop moving! I'm trying to capture the moment. I wanted to do a painting, so we always remember the good times together. Those are your hair loopies! I thought it looked more exciting that way. Oh, you think you can do a better job, Momo?   As a matter of fact, they do not.  Then what was the point? Well, scientifically speaking, there's no way to prove that ...  I knew it! You signaled the Fire Navy with that flare! You're leading them straight to us, aren't you?  Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy. The foreigner is banished from our village.  No, I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you, from threats like him!  Fun?! We can't fight firebenders with fun!  Get out of our village! Now!>  Where do you think you're> going? Katara! Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?  Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.>  Yeah, I thought so! All right, ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!  And no potty breaks!  Oh man!  Oh maaan ...  Hi, Aang. Thanks for coming.  No way! Katara, I --  Katara! Are you gonna talk all day, or are you comin' with me?  Get in, we're going to save your boyfriend.  Whatever.  Yeah, okay Gran.   You just looove taking me out of my comfort zone, don't you?  Go. Fly. Soar.  Up. Ascend. Elevate. What was it that kid said? Yee-haw? Hup-hup? Wah-hoo? Uh ... Yip-yip?  He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's -  I mean, big deal. He's flying.   Now that was some waterbending! Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.  Got it!  Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!  Katara!  I'm just a guy, with a boomerang. I didn't ask for all this flying and magic!> Yip-yip! Yip-yip!  I'd like that. I'd reeally like that.  There it is!  Not bad, not bad. But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar State.  Why not? Remember when he took out the Fire Navy? He was incredible!  Or just glow it up and stop that Fire Lord!  I guess he could talk the Fire Lord to death. Maybe I can shock you into the Avatar State. Huh? You sure?  Okay. What can he say? You're the Avatar. Who knows better than you? Aang!  The general's gone crazy! He's trying to force Aang into the Avatar State!  Good ... bird ... horse thingy ...  Katara! No! Anybody got a problem with that?  Aang, good to see you back with the living, buddy! After what happened at Ba Sing Se, we had to get you to safety. We flew back to Chameleon Bay where we found my father and the other Water Tribe men. The Earth King decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise, so he set off alone. Well, not completely alone. Soon, the bay was overrun by Fire Nation ships. Rather than fight them all, we captured a single ship and made it our disguise. Since then we've been traveling west. We crossed through the Serpent's Pass a few days ago. We've seen a few Fire Nation ships, but none have bothered us. So we're planning a smaller invasion. Just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the Earth Kingdom. We already ran into Pipsqueak and The Duke. And the best part is, the eclipse isn't even our biggest advantage! We have a secret...  You! Yep, the whole world thinks you're dead! Isn't that great?   No, it's great! It means the Fire Nation won't be hunting us anymore! And even better, they won't be expecting you on the Day of Black Sun!  Aang, no! You're still hurt, and you have to stay secret! Just let us handle this. Things couldn't get much worse. The universe just loves proving me wrong, doesn't it? Thank you, the universe! Here, tie this around your head. It will cover your arrow. Aang, come on. Be practical. We'll join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse. This is crazy! How can we beat a guy who blows things up with his mind?  It's pricey ... but I really do like it. I do, don't I? But no, it's too expensive. I shouldn't.  You know what? I'm gonna get it.   Oh, I got to remember that one!  What was I thinking? I don't need a new bag! Why did you let me buy this? I guess that's why.  That's what I paid for.  Go back to the Fire Nation! Yeah! Wooo! The Boulder knows how to put the hurt in the dirt! Yeah! Woohoo!  I think she is ... going down! Go Aang! Avenge The Boulder! Boo! No talking!  Way to go, champ! I've got to admit, now I'm really glad I bought this bag. It matches the belt, perfectly.  Nicely done.  Water Tribe. Don't answer to Twinkle Toes, it's not manly! Look, we all have to do our part to win this war, and yours is to teach Aang earthbending. Whoever took Aang and Toph left this.   I can't believe it ... I have The Boulder's autograph! Here's your money. Now let them go. I'm trying! Well, we'd better get out of here, before your dad changes his mind again. Sorry. You know what I love about Appa the most? His sense of humor.  Classic Appa.  Take that, you rock!  Ha, ha! You guys are killing me!  Katara, please, water.  Water ...  Who's this "Aang" kid you keep talking about, Your Highness?   Aang, how was your trip? Did you make any new friends? Mmmm! This is tasty! Mmm! Hey, can I talk to you for a second?  If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken? When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where they might be. What? Why not? It's my dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through. Please. What's that? So, where is this place? Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid. Thanks, Zuko. Just knowing makes me feel better.  Shhh.  Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my dad. You happy now?  Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was my idea, it was my decision to stay when things were going wrong. It's my mistake, and it's my job to fix it. I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me, Zuko.  No. I have to do this alone. Pretty clouds. What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons. Yep, a balloon ... but for war. Yeah, it seems to run in the family. I know, I know, you've changed. I think your uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us? That's hard. Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?  That gloomy girl who sighs a lot? My first girlfriend turned into the moon. The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly! I don't know! Crash-landing? We'll figure something out! I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.  My dad might be here! I had to come and see!  Hey, I never wanted you to come along in the first place! And for the record, I always think things through! But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time, I'm playing it by ear. So there.  It doesn't work anyway, and we don't want anyone to find it. We just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible. We can't blow our cover. Super cute.  Meet back here in an hour.   Prisoners! Am I right? It sure looks cold in there.  Zuko? What? Are you sure, did you double-check? No. No!  So we came all this way for nothing? I failed ... again. Maybe we haven't failed after all! No, what you said made no sense at all. But look ... It's Suki!  You mean you don't recognize me?  Oh? Then maybe you'll recognize this.  The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?  Well, you won't be here for long. I'm busting you out.  You're under arrest! Don't worry, I'll figure it out. Oh, good, you guys have met. So, listen, I think I have an escape plan. I checked out the coolers again, and the point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right? So, they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well, to keep the cold in, it also has to keep the heat out, right? It's a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water. I'm telling you, it'll work. I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. I already tested it out. We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current. It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound, no one will notice. And bing-bang-boom, we're home free.  What? We didn't ... w-we didn't say that. Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is ... an egg? Okay, you're in. Now first we need someone to unbolt the cooler, from the inside.  I need backup over here! I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.  I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore. I know. I don't know! Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom, all of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up? Fine. Everybody in the cooler. Let's go.   If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.  That supposed to make me feel better? Seriously, not helping. No. I'm staying. You guys go. You've been here long enough. We gave up our only chance of escaping. I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake. The plan failed! They're caught! The gondola's moving. This is it. If my dad's not there, we've risked everything for nothing. Come on, come on ... My dad doesn't have a nose ring. Where is he? That's it? That can't be it. Oh, no.  Dad ... Dad ... Excuse me, coming through. The warden wants me over there. Sorry!  Thank goodness you're okay.  Dad, it's me.  Yeah, I ran into that problem earlier.  So where's Bato? Where's everyone else from the invasion?  You mean the Kyoshi Warriors? Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us. And you know Prince Zuko? Well, he's here too. Actually, he's on our side now. I know. I had the same reaction. After all he's done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself, and I never would've found you without his help.   We had one, but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it. I dunno if there's another way off this island. Then we'd better find two.  Zuko, are you there? I just got done talking to my dad. We came up with an escape plan together.  I was just telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!  Why? Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?   Take that ... and this!   We have a new plan, but it's gonna need a big distraction. Be in the yard in one hour.  I don't have much time. If I'm seen with you the guards might think something's up. I just talked to my dad. Yeah, and we're escaping today, on the gondola. My dad and I came up with the plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines. My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot. Not if the warden is the captive. I have to go. I'll find you before we start the riot.  Why? Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow?  Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard. Oh, okay, I'll just go tell the warden you said that. I'm sure he'll be glad to hear about you undermining his authority. What's your name again? Hey, I'm confused too, but the warden's in a bad mood, and ... irrational, so if you ask me, it's best not to question it, and just do what he says.  This is it! We have to start a riot. This isn't working.  Actually, we're trying to escape right now, but we need a riot. You wouldn't happen to know how to start one, would you? Zuko! Good, we're all here. Now all we need to do is grab the warden, and get to the gondolas! I'm not sure. I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!  Tell me about it. What are you doing? Way to think ahead. Who's that? Zuko, what are you doing? Yeah, and she's probably right behind us, so let's not stop! I did. The best meat of all. The meat of friendship and fatherhood. We kind of went to a Fire Nation prison. It's not getting away from me this time. Watch and learn, Katara. This is how you catch a fish.  Sshh! Katara, you're going to scare it away. Mmmm ... I can already smell it cookin'. Why is it that every time you play with magic water, I get soaked?  Yeah, yeah, "an ancient art unique to our culture", blah, blah, blah. Look, I'm just saying that if I had weird powers, I'd keep my weirdness to myself. You don't like my steering? Well, maybe you should've waterbended us out of the ice.  I knew I should've left you home! Leave it to a girl to screw things up!  Uh ... Katara ...  Katara, settle down! Okay, you've gone from "weird" to "freakish", Katara.  Yep. Congratulations. Katara, get back here! We don't know what that thing is!  Stop!  You tell us! How did you get in the ice? And why aren't you frozen?  What is that thing?  Right, and this is Katara, my flying sister.   Don't >answer that! Did you see that crazy bolt of light?! He was probably trying to signal the Fire Navy!  You just sneezed ... and flew ten feet in the air! Giant light beams, flying bison, airbenders ... I think I got midnight sun madness. I'm going home to where stuff makes sense.  Oh no! I'm not getting on that fluffy snot monster!  Wow, that was truly amazing ...  What is this, a weapon? You can't stab anything with this!  Ya know, last time I checked, humans can't fly!>  My watchtower!  Great. You're an airbender, Katara's a waterbender. Together you can just waste time all day long.   Now men, it's important that you show no fear when you face a firebender. In the Water Tribe, we fight to the last man standing! For without courage, how can we call ourselves men?   Listen! Until your fathers return from the War, they're counting on you to be the men of this tribe, and that means no potty breaks!   Okay, who else has to go?  Uh! Katara, get him out of here! This lesson is for warriors only!  Stop! Stop it right now! What's wrong with you?! We don't have time for fun and games with the War> going on!  You're kidding, right? He's kidding, right?  You guys are going to be done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu today. I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, whenever.  Who are you? Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up to me. We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms and definitely no rainbows.  O. Ma. Shu!  I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.  Secret love cave, let's go. How far are we from the tunnel?  Labyrinth?  Curse!  What exactly is this curse? That's it! There's no way we're going through some cursed hole!  It's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.  Everyone into the hole! We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?  It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time! I'm going to make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through. This doesn't make sense. We already came through this way.  There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. The tunnels are changing.  Right, if only we listened to you.  Nooooo!  At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.  Yes! We're all thinking of ideas! No, they were trying to get away from something!  Badgermoles coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out! How did you guys get out? Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.  Just play your songs.  The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about: the destination. I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O- Oh no ... That's not grass.   Appa's shedding.  It's not that bad, Katara. It makes a great wig!  Your powers of perception are frightening.  Hey, I'm just enjoying the show.  Hey, how's a guy supposed to sleep with all this yelling and earthquaking? Well, how far away is it? Maybe we can close our eyes just for a few minutes.  Okay, forget about setting up camp. I'm finding the softest pile of dirt and going to sleep.  Oh, just some angry freak with a ponytail who's tracked us all over the world.  This is a warrior's wolf tail.  Anyway, whoever's chasing us couldn't have followed us here, so, now would everyone just shhh?  No Momo, shhh. Sleepy time.  Oh, don't tell me ...  Always the optimist ... Actually Toph, there's four of us.  I can still fight!  Errrgh! Well, we wanted to find out who they were and we found out. Now let's get out of here.  Oh no, the sun is rising. We've been up all night with no sleep!  Are you sure? I've never not slept before! What if I fall asleep now and something happens? And something always happens!  Yes ... sleep.  Okay, we've put in a lot of distance between us and them. The plan right now is to follow Appa's lead and get some sleep.  Wait!  Yeah, you two were pretty much jerks. No problem. Okay, but what are we going to do about the tank full of dangerous ladies chasing us?  Toph couldn't have made it too far. What is it, Momo? Ooooh, no! Katara!  Appa, come on, we need to go faster!  Not good, not good! We just need to make it across that river!  We made it! We're safe.  Good try, but no. How are you doing?  Thanks Appa, I don't know what we'd do without you. So, what kind of trouble is Katara in? It would be nice if your Avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time. What is that? Need a ride? Aang, are you okay? See, Aang? She's with Suki. They're probably back at our apartment right now talking about make-up or something. Oh, no!  Whoa there! You lost me at "Zuko".  "Good inside him" isn't enough! Why don't you come back when it's outside him too, okay? My sister! Where are they keeping Katara? We should split up. Aang, you go with Iroh to look for Katara and the angry jerk, no offense. And I'll go with Toph to warn the Earth King of Azula's coup. There's General How! The coup is happening right now! We've gotta warn the Earth King! Thank goodness we're in time!  Uh, I'm kinda involved with Suki. Nope, all clear. Let's go.   No. That is the invasion!  Were you able to locate everyone I told you to find? Was that a new invention?  You're making peanut sauce bombs? Where you able to complete work on the plans I send you? Good morning everyone. Ahh! Umm ... so, as you know, today, we're invading the Fire Nation! I mean I know you know that because otherwise why else would you be here? Uh anyway, the Fire Lord's palace is here . Uh nope, uh wait, uh wait, uh wait, it's here, and uh, there's an eclipse today and Aang's gonna fight the Fire Lord and the firebenders won't have any fire to use so that's good for us! And ... um ... I'm sorry let me start at the beginning . Katara and I discovered Aang frozen in an iceberg, now I didn't like Aang at first but grew to love him over time, then we went to the Southern Air Temple where Aang used to live and then we met Suki, who's a Kyoshi warrior. She dressed me like a woman and then she kissed me, and then Aang's friend was a crazy old king and ... ... And then Katara got Haru arrested and then now he's grown a mustache which if you look at him in the front row you can see it ... I messed up, Aang. The invasion plan was my moment of truth and I completely flubbed it. I just fell apart. My dad is! He explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone, like a real leader should. You seem so confident about everything, how do you know we're gonna win? Well, I just came up with the idea. The mechanist did all the work. Are you ready for the Fire Nation to know the Avatar is alive? Katara, what are you doing? It's time to submerge. Dad, look out! I've got an idea. Dad!  Can't you heal him any faster?  I'll do it. No. I'll lead the invasion force. Maybe I am a little crazy, but the eclipse is about to start and we need to be up that volcano by the time it does.  Yip yip. Listen up, everyone. I want the tanks in wedge formation. Warriors and benders in the middle. We're taking that tower, and heading for the royal palace. Charge! Who's going to save our lives now? We'll never make it out of here. You think if we dig out the giant owl, he'll give us a ride?  Can't you watch where you're ...  Right. Sorry. If I sweat anymore, I don't think sticking together will be a problem.  We're drinking your bending water. You used this on the swamp guy! Urch! Not anymore! Look! There's water trapped inside these!  Suit yourself. It's very thirst quenching though.  Drink cactus juice. It'll quench ya! Nothing's quenchier. It's the quenchiest! Who lit Toph on fire?  How did we get out here in the middle of the ocean? It's a giant mushroom! Maybe it's friendly! Friendly mushroom! Mushy giant friend!  Why don't we ask the circle birds?  Momo, no! You've killed us all!  Oh, right. Bending.  What?! I didn't steal anything! Who told you that? It was you! You ratted me out! Appa‌? But why would Princess Yue need him‌? She's the moon! She flies by herself!  Take it easy little lady. I'm sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here.  I think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice. And look! Tastes like rotten penguin meat! Awww, I feel woozy. I have a natural curiosity.  What are you doing? That rock almost crushed me! I got this one. I guess my head's not as clear as I thought. Yeah! You got it! She got it, right‌? Just get out of here! Run!  See if you can find a menu, I'm starving!   You might wanna rethink that. Look at this. A wanted poster! This is bad.   What? You wanna walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired-up with their ... you know, fire?   Yeah! Because we always leave before we get into trouble.  It's like you're a whole different person ...  Where are we gonna get masks like that? That was surprisingly easy. Finally! What do you have? I'll take'em! Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!  Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.  What do you think you're doing? No, we don't want to make a scene! I think it's time to go. I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!  You really know your explosives ... You're a Fire Nation Soldier!  He was very highly ranked, we get it.  We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender! Look, thanks for the help, but we're leaving for the North Pole in the morning.  That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me? Hold on, you know these guys? Finally! Let's hit the road.   Hey!  Katara, what's wrong? What did you do?! I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister>! You burned my sister! This is all your fault! Katara! Are you all right? Aang, come on! Let's go! He disappeared. They all did. When did you learn that?  Oh ... Well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the greaseberry bramble. Or that time I had two fishhooks in my thumb!  Oh, and the time that mink snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful. Now what's so big that Appa has to wait? That's a good group name. Very catchy.  Get a hold of yourself, man! Why are you all looking at me?  So I'm the only one who can ever come up with a plan? That's a lot of pressure. That part I don't mind.  Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! Ooh! What you just said! That's how we're going to take down the drill! The same way Ty Lee took down all those big earthbenders! It's so dark down here, I can't see a thing!  Sorry. There! Toph, come on! Okay, good luck!  I need a plan of this machine. Some schematics that show what the inside looks like. Then we can find its weak points. That's the point. I figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it. And when something breaks ... This'll work. Thanks! It looks like the drill is made up of two main structures. There's the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell. The inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces. If we cut through them, the entire thing will collapse. Wow, it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans. We're going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that.  Look, I'm the plan guy. You two are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys. Together, we're Team Avatar!  C'mon team. Don't quit now. We're ... I mean, you're almost there. Do you hear that? We took it down! We better get out of here fast!  C'mon brace ... budge!  We're putting everything we've got into busting these braces, but it's taking too long!  And boom! It all comes crashing down! The whole world minus the Fire Nation that is. Good work, Team Avatar! Now Aang just needs to ... duck!  Hey.  It's rock and water mixed together. It means our way out! Katara, keep that up. The pressure will build up in the drill. Then when Aang delivers the final blow, it'll be ready to pop! Good technique, little sister! Keep it up! Don't forget to breathe!  Just bend the slurry, woman! Woohoo! I just want to say, good effort out there today, Team Avatar! How about ... the Boomeraang Squad! See it's good because it's got "Aang" in it. Boomeraang. The Aang Gang? The Fearsome Foursome? Why? We're fearsome! Look, we escaped from the Dai Li. We got Appa back. I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll. We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we'll need the Earth King's support. I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different. See? Aang's with me. It's the whole reason we came here in the first place. We have to try. That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. So? There it is! That whole thing is the palace! The Earth King's chamber should be in the center! Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in and- Aahh! Surface-to-air rocks! More incoming! Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side! Sorry. In there!  Toph, which way to the Earth King?  Sorry. Wrong door. Now that's an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere. Yaaah! A little warning next time? No, we're on your side. We're here to help. But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies. Uh, no. Him.  Wait! I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a sky bison. Ask him to lift his robe. Never met a sky bison, huh? Of course there is! Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place. Oh don't tell me- ! That's okay. Still got my positive attitude. Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.   If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.  It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation to break through your walls.   Looks like Long Feng is long gone! Ha! Ah, yeah, I've been waiting to use that one.  That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness: because we think you can help us end the war. But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity: A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be completely blocked out by the moon, and the firebenders will be helpless. That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun. You're already vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance.  Oh.  What? That could be Dad! What's a guru? Some kind of poisonous blow fish? This is all such big news! Where do we even start? Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me.  You are the nicest ... sister ... ever!   All right. Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip?   That's Suki!   Oh yeah. The Kyoshi Warriors are a skilled group of fighters. Trustworthy too. They're good friends of ours.  Aahh! Great. That's enough. Okay, we love each other. Seriously. You see, Aang? A little positive thinking works wonders. We got the king on our side, we got Long Feng arrested, and when we get back, Suki's waiting for me. Everything is gonna work out perfectly. From now on and forever.  You guys are not gonna believe this! There's a play about us. Listen to this ... "The Boy in the Iceberg> is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu-on Tim, who scoured the globe gathering information on the Avatar, from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se. His sources include singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war, and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage."  Come on, a day at the theater? This is the kind of wacky time-wasting nonsense I've been missing!   This is pathetic! My jokes are way funnier than this!  [Placing a finger on Suki's lips] Shhh! I'm trying to watch!   Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot who tells bad jokes about meat all the time!  I know! You know, it was really unclear.  Oh, you're getting up? Can you get me some fire flakes? Ooh, and fire gummies!  You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did! I'm just saying ... He left to get me fire gummies, like, ten minutes ago. And I'm still waiting! Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage? I got some jokes I want to give to the actor me. Actually, I think I can help you. I'm a big Sokka fan, but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.  Just hear me out. Here's something I think the real Sokka would say. What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages? A cabbage patch!  Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases, especially before an attack. Something like ... "Flying kick-a-pow!".  I'm just a guy who likes comedy. Here's what you missed ... we went to the Fire Nation, and you got better, and Katara was the Painted Lady, and I got a sword, and I think Combustion Man died. Oh, look, the Invasion's about to start! Shhh!  I told him to say that!  I guess that's it. The play's caught up to the present now.  But it is over, unless ... this is the future.  But the effects were decent. Hey, jerks! Mind if I watch you two jerks do your jerkbending? Okay, take it easy. I was just kiddin' around. Jerkbending, still got it.   Sooo, all we need to do is make Zuko angry. Easy enough.  How's he supposed to do that‌? By jumping into a volcano‌?  So, is it jumping into a volcano? So, what? Maybe you'll pick up some super old Sun Warrior energy just by standing where they stood a thousand years ago? Yeah, that's a great dance you two learned there.  We'll just tap-dance our way to victory over the Fire Lord. He is taunting us! You are so going to be dinner!  Hey, where's the fishing line?  Aw, it's all tangled!  Great, Aang. Maybe instead of saving the world, you can go into the jewelry-making business. Stop taunting me!  Smoochie, smoochie, someone's in love!  No, play dead! He'll lose interest! No, punch him in the bill!   Mmm, lunch! Lucky for you, we came along. But the fortuneteller was wrong! You didn't have a safe journey; you were almost killed! Oh, come on. Fortune telling is nonsense!  No, it doesn't! You can't really tell the future!  Of course she predicted it was going to rain. The sky's been gray all day! Look, I'm going to predict the future now. It's going to keep drizzling. See?  Agh!  I'll try a curd puff.  Don't be modest! They're huge! I can't believe we're here in the house of nonsense.  It would be nice to have some bean curd puffs.  Mm, not bad, not bad! Mhm?  Boring stuff I'm sure. Love, who she's going to marry, how many babies she's going to have. Looks like someone had a pretty good bathroom break.  I don't even want to know!  Okay, let's get this over with.  But you didn't read my palms or anything! Well, now you got to see for yourselves how fortune telling is just a big, stupid hoax.  That woman is crazy! My life will calm and happy and joyful! That doesn't prove anything!  Do you even hear yourself? I can't believe you would trust your lives to that crazy, old woman's superstition! I can't believe all these saps! Someone really needs to scream some sense into them. Not for long. I'm going to prove Aunt Wu's predictions are nonsense. Hey you, I bet Aunt Wu told you to wear those red shoes, didn't she?  Uh huh ... And how many times have you worn those shoes since you got that fortune?  Then of course it's gonna come true!  I don't care what Aunt Wu told you! You have to take a bath sometime!  Some stuff? You've come to the right place. What can I do you for?  I think I know who you mean. Of course I am. And to tell you the truth, I've been picking up a subtle vibe that she likes you, too. Oh yeah, she's crazy about you. All you have to do now is not mess it up. The number once mistake nice guys like you make: being too nice. Yep. If you want to keep her interested, you have to act aloof, like you don't really care one way or the other.  Wow, that kid is good.  I can't believe you're dragging me all the way up here for a stupid flower. Flowers are fine once you're married, but at this early stage, it's critical that you maintain maximum aloofness.  What? Don't tell me you believe in that stuff, too. Those people all think they're safe! We've got to warn them! Well, we have other things to worry about. Aunt Wu was wrong about the volcano.  Everyone, that volcano is gonna blow any second! Aunt Wu was wrong! Look! Can your fortune telling explain that?  Yes! Yes, it can! I know that's the problem. Aunt Wu, look! Something is happening in the clouds.  Lava is gonna flow downhill to this spot. If we can dig a deep enough trench we can channel all the lava away from the village to the river. Everybody else grab a shovel Come on! We've gotta hurry!  Dig faster! Dig faster! Man, sometimes I forget what a powerful bender that kid is.   Nothing, just that Aang is one powerful bender. No offense, but I hope this taught everyone a lesson about not relying too much on fortune telling.  I hate you. Right, got it ...  Ordinarily, you'd be right, but seeing how it's the dry season, you're not. Besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket.  What if it doesn't? Then I would have put up the tarp for nothing. Katara, why don't you worry about gathering firewood, because that kindling is looking pretty sorry.  Fine by me, if you're not gonna do your job-  Why don't you ask Miss Know-It-All, Queen of the Twigs.  Whatever. Okay, I've seen enough. Then I'm sure we'll be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away. Calm down, we know you're next. Aang, this feuding tribe stuff is serious business. Are you sure it's a good idea getting involved in this?  His job's gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isn't it?  We gotta help him! Okay, now we gotta help me!  I thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldn't have to deal with things like canyon crawlers. So, you guys aren't going to put up your tarps? Exactly!  Finally, someone gets it! Would I!  Hm-hmm.  Hmm. That's just terrible. You gonna finish that? Yeah Katara, what are you talking about? Wei Jin didn't steal the orb, he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the Gan Jin.  We barely survived one! Me too. I only took their side 'cause they fed me. That's some luck you knew Jin Wei and Wei Jin.  What?  I know I should be, but, I just feel sick to my stomach.  So what about you? Are you nervous to meet this guru? Hi, Dad. Destructive? Buoyant? And ... Aggh, ehhh! Terrible smelling!  Good one, Dad! Uhhh ... what should I do, Dad? You don't know how much this means to me, Dad. I'll make you proud and I'll finally prove to you what a great warrior I am. Really? This can't be good news.  Sh! Keep quiet! Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut.   Hey, we're in enemy territory. Those are enemy birds. Well, this is it. This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins. Hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave ... Looks like we got outvoted, sport. Let's get some new clothes. Come on, Aang, everyone here eats meat. Even the meat!   After what?!  Enrolled in what?!  Aang, I'm trying to be mature and not immediately shoot down your idea, but it sounds ... really terrible. Impressive, I admit, but I still think it's too dangerous. Hmm, I am a fan of secret rivers ... fine, let's stay a few more days.  Flamey-O?  Fire. Wang Fire. This is my wife, Sapphire. Don't you worry, Mr. Headmaster. I'll straighten this boy out somethin' fierce! Young man, as soon as we get home you're gonna get the punishment of a lifetime!   That settles it! No more school for you, young man!  What could you possibly do for a country of depraved little fire monsters?  Go to your room!  I can't believe we're having a dance party. It seems so ... silly.  Wow, they look pretty good together.  Oh, no, I can't. It's permanently glued to my skin.  Flamey-O, sir ... Flamey-O.  They have buildings here that don't melt!  You need a disguise. Great! Now you look just like my grandfather.  Great, so they get their mail on time.  What? It was pretty funny.  We're in serious trouble. This guy is nuts.> Nice or not, we're prisoners!  If you think we're going to fit through there, you're crazier than that king. Eh, how was Appa supposed to save us anyway?  Ah! It's already creeping! Oh, come on! I got it! He's an earthbender, right? Rocky. You know, because of all the rocks. Little help? Why did you do all of this instead of just telling Aang who you were? What's out here?  Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da.  This is great and all, but don't we have more important things to worry about? We should be making plans. There's no time for vacations. Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of the Fire Nation. Should we just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war. I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan our strategy. Excuse me. So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map? Ours seems to be a little dated. What, no Fire Nation? Doesn't anybody have a good map of that place?  Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants, huh? If this place has books from all over the world, do you think they've got info on the Fire Nation? A map, maybe? Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation at the library!  You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time. Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?  Down there, what's that?  What kind of animal is that?  No, this is the library- look! It's completely buried. That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a look. Are you the spirit who brought this library to the physical world?  What? No-no-no-no destroying. We're not into that. Um ... knowledge for knowledge's sake? I'm not lying, I'm here with the Avatar, and he's the bridge between our worlds. He'll vouch for me.   Oh, great spirit, check this out. Ta-da! It's a special knot. That counts as knowledge!  Bright enough to fool you.  Eh, I've seen weirder.  "The darkest day in Fire Nation history." It's got a date at the top, but it doesn't say anything else.   I want to know what happened to the Fire Nation on their darkest day. This could be promising. The information on the Fire Nation should be right up here. That's so unfair! Just when I think I'm one step ahead of the Fire Nation, it turns out they beat us here a long time ago. I need to know what happened on the darkest day. Hello, little weird fox guy. Um, sure, I guess I'll follow you. Uh, this is beautiful, but how is it helpful?  Shh, Katara, not in front of the fox, he's with the owl.  It's not broken. The sun is behind the moon. It's a solar eclipse! It's literally the darkest day in Fire Nation history. Now I get it. Something awful happened on that day. I don't know what, but I do know why. Firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse. Sorry.  Fine, you earned it. We've gotta get this information to the Earth King at Ba Sing Se. We'll wait for the next eclipse, then we'll invade the Fire Nation when they're totally helpless. The Fire Lord is going down! You don't understand. If anyone's evil, it's the Fire Nation. You saw what they did to your library. They're destructive and dangerous. We need this information. But we still don't know when the next eclipse is gonna to happen. No, we won't. If we leave this place, we'll never get the information. Aang, come with me to the planetarium, I need cover. Katara, take Momo and get out of here! Go! Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can project when the next one will be.  I don't have to. We just need to check every date before Sozin's Comet arrives. Because after that- well, try not to think about that. That's it! The solar eclipse! It's just a few months away. Got it. Now, let's get to Ba Sing Se. That's called Sokka style. Learn it. Wait! Professor, let's go. We got it. There's a solar eclipse coming. The Fire Nation's in trouble now! Sorry ...  You want me to be like you, or totally honest?  I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing, basically.  What do you mean "they're not"? Those guys are flying! We better find some solid ground, before it finds us.   Wow! This glider chair is incredible! Wow!  So better! Wait, how can you tell the time from that thing? The notches all look the same. You put spark powder in the candle!  Aaah! These lanterns are terrible. I can't see! Why would you want to use fireflies for light?   Okay ... so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room. So, this place is an explosion waiting to happen.  Ugh! Week old egg smell! How can something so small that you can't even see it make such a big stink!? Yeah ... if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up ... Then, if there's a leak ... And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!  You make weapons for the Fire Nation?! Very bad! Thank you. You're a genius! See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it air-borne, but once it did, it just kept going. You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air? A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon. Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs: smoke, slime, fire, and ... Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?  Then I guess they won't see this coming.  Oh no, that was the last one.  Rotten eggs! There! That's were the gas is escaping. It's the only bomb we've got.  We're going down!  Get ready!  Aang you were right about air power. As long as we've got the skies, we'll have the Fire Nation on the run.  Well that explains why I can't catch a fish around here, because normally my fishing skills are off the hook! Get it? Like a fishing hook?  Hmmm ... It's doable. But that means only two potty breaks today. It's in the middle of the river!  No, we can't waste our time here. We have a bigger mission that we need to stay focused on. These people are on their own.  I'm not turning my back, I'm just being realistic. We can't go around helping every rinky-dink town we wander into. We'll be helping them all by taking out the Fire Lord.  Come on, Katara, be reasonable about this. You know our mission has to come first. Hey, Dock. You work here too?  We'll just take the fish. Mind telling your brother we need a ride back to shore?  Our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule. It's gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track. Well, for starters, it looks like we'll need to wake up forty-three minutes earlier every day.  Look, we only have a few weeks to get to the Fire Lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse, which, by the way, only lasts for eight minutes. And we just lost a whole day. So if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule, we have to wake up early! Or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks.  I got it, how's this from now on, we'll take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time. Hey, it might be gross, but it's efficient. Either way, we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning.  What? Appa's sick? That's awful! Of course I care. I might as well just throw our schedule away now. And I'm concerned because my big, furry friend doesn't feel well. Hey, Xu, what's going on with everyone today? See, we don't need to help these people, they already have someone to help them. All we need is medicine for our sick friend.  I guess you're right. You got any more food to sell?  Two-headed! What? You get more for your money that way!  Hi, Dock. Is Xu around?  And maybe she'll cook us a midnight snack, and we'll all have a sing-along. Well, I hope she returns every night. Otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was. Yeah, now, but without her they wouldn't be able to fend for themselves. If she really wanted to help, she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory.   Oh, really? A morning walk? I know you're the Painted Lady, I know you've been sneaking out at night, and I know you've been lying about Appa and been feeding him purpleising tongue berries! Katara, what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy. We're leaving right now! And how long did you know about this?  What did you do? You what? I was joking! I also said to use spirit magic and made funny noises! Did you even think this through? The army is gonna blame the villagers! They're headed there right now to get revenge! Leave! Do nothing! Wait! I'm coming, too. You need me, and I will never turn my back on you. Maybe she is a waterbender, but she was just trying to help you. Because of her, that factory won't be polluting your river, and the army is gone. You should be down on your knees thanking her! You wouldn't mind keeping that a secret, by the way, would you?  Suddenly, they heard something down the hall in the dark. Oooh ... It came into the torchlight ... and they knew the blade of Wing Fung was haunted! Ooh-aaah!  Is this one of those "a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to" stories?  Where'd she go? Pfft! Nice try.  Yes, please. What do you mean "disappearing"? I know, Momo. This place is creepy! I don't know if I'm gonna be able to fall asleep! People disappearing in the woods, weird stuff happening during full moons? This just reeks of Spirit World shenanigans.  And then you can sew up this little mystery lickety-split, Avatar style!  This is a mysterious little town you have here. That Hama seems a little strange. Like she knows something, or she's hiding something. But what did she mean by that comment, "mysterious children"? I'm gonna take a look around.  It'll be fine.  I'm not finished yet. Come on ... Just an ordinary puppet-loving innkeeper, huh? Well then why does she have a locked door up here? We'll see. It's empty, except for a little chest. I have to see what's in there. Maybe there's a key here somewhere ...  Come on, come on! Suit yourself! Do it, Toph!  An old comb? But why didn't you tell us? And I knew you were keeping a secret, so I guess we're both right. But I'm sorry we were sneaking around. So how did you end up out here? How did you get away? And why did you stay in the Fire Nation?  The Moon Spirit is a gentle, loving lady. She rules the sky with compassion and ... lunar goodness!  We wanted to ask you about that. Why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain? I can't see anything down there. A witch? What do you mean?  Hama! I knew there was something creepy about her! We know what you've been doing, Hama!  Katara, look out! It's like my brain has a mind of its own! Stop it arm, stop it!  Sneak Attack!  Yes! Look at all those messenger hawks! You know, I've been thinking about getting one for myself. That way, I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I could just send them messages.  She used earthbending to win the game! Classic! Speaking of that "third-eyed freak", I think I've come up with a name for him. What do you think of "Sparky-Sparky-Boom Man"? Just think about it.  Speaking of money, I'm off to spend some. See you guys later.  Hawky, welcome to Team Avatar. My name's Sokka, and I'm your new owner, and as such I should warn you that there's already a lemur in our group, so I don't wanna see any fighting. Good little messenger hawky. Who's got pretty feathers? You're right, Hawky. This is bad.  Toph, while I was in town, I found something that you're not gonna like.  It's a wanted poster. Of you. They've nicknamed you the Runaway.  Well yeah, actually, it does look pretty good. But, Toph, you're missing the point. Maybe Katara was right. These scams are drawing too much attention to us.  Well, that is true. I had this idea of making armor for Appa.   I do like expensive atlases. Not just a bird, a messenger bird. Now we can send messages all over the world. Even to Gran Gran. Hm. Uh, I never actually thought about that. Hawky, Gran Gran, South Pole. I think he gets it. Hawky! Make nice! Bad Hawky!  Hey. I'm staying out of this one.  I know, Hawky. Why can't they just get along? Hey, Aang. You wanna test out my messenger hawk with me? I've got an idea.  I'm going to send a note to Katara and say it's from Toph, who wants to apologize. Then everyone will be friends again. It's a gift. "Dear Katara, sorry for everything. Your friend, Toph." Yup. We're idiots.  I think we're gonna run into a similar problem. Sorry, Hawky. Looks like I'm gonna have to do this without your help. Come on. We need to talk. Nah, she's pretty much a pain. She's always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business ... Actually, in a way, I rely on it.  When our mom died, that was the hardest time in my life. Our family was a mess, but Katara? She had so much strength. She stepped up and took on so much responsibility. She helped fill the void that was left by our mom. I'm gonna tell you something crazy. I never told anyone this before, but honestly? I'm not sure I can remember what my mother looked like. It really seems like my whole life, Katara's been the one looking out for me. She's always been the one that's there. And now, when I try to remember my mom, Katara's is the only face I can picture.  Hey, my lips are sealed. I was just wondering the same thing. We'd better check it out. You two behave. Appa's in charge.  Where do you think they might be? You know, I'm starting to think that name doesn't quite fit. This guy is too good! He shoots fire from his brain!  Hey, I got it! The perfect name for that guy: "Combustion Man!" See? It fits so well!  Well, I'm exhausted. Hawky, how about you, buddy? Yeah. You're such a lazy little bird. Hey, where'd Hawky go?  Sure, five thousand year-old maps from the spirit library. Just splash some water on 'em. Okay, we just got out of the desert, so we must be around here. And we need to go to Ba Sing Se, which is here. It looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the Serpent's Pass. It's the only way. I mean, it's not like we have Appa to fly us there. Then to Ba Sing Se we go. No more distractions. Well, we are desperate. Don't you know who this is? He's the Avatar! All right, we scammed that lady good! Is there a problem? Do I know you? Suki!  Ahhh, I'll grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then. Nothing major. I can't believe we gave up our tickets and now we're going through the Serpent's Pass. Are you sure that's a good idea? I do, it's just– Nothing. I'm glad you're coming. This is the Serpent's Pass? I thought it would be a little more wind-y, you know, like a serpent. Huh, I guess they misnamed it. They've spotted us! Let's go, let's go! Suki, are you okay? You have to be more careful! Come on! Suki, you shouldn't sleep there. Who knows how stable this ledge is, it could give away at any moment!  You're right, you're right, you're perfectly capable of taking care of yourself! Wait! Oh, never mind, I thought I saw a spider, but, you're fine. Yeah, it really is. I know you can. It's so hard to lose someone you care about. Something happened at the North Pole and I couldn't protect someone. I don't want anything like that to ever happen again.  Who is this guy? Is he taller than me? Is he better-looking? Oh! I can't. No, you shouldn't be.  I think I just figured out why they call it the Serpent's Pass! Suki, you know about giant sea monsters, make it go away!  Oh great and powerful sea serpent, please accept this humble and tasty offering. Thank you. Toph, come on, it's just ice! You're doing great! Just follow the sound of my voice! You're almost there! I'm coming, Toph! There's the wall! Now it's nothing but smooth sailing to Ba Sing Se. What's wrong?  What? Now? Can't you hold it in or something? This isn't the same as delivering an arctic seal! This is a real ... human ... thing! No, no, I'm good this time.  It's so ... squishy looking. See you in the big city. Whoa, hold on. Why does it sound like you're saying goodbye? So you came along to protect me?  You talk too much.  Are you kidding? I grew up in a block of ice. It's not exactly a cultural hub.  What's wrong? We're taking a walk!  I know what you need. You need to meet my good friend, Appa.  Appa and I go way back, don't we, boy? Ah, ah, easy! Down boy! Agh! No, up! You holding on tight? Yip ... yip.  Yeah, we pretty much live up here.  Not when you're with someone. Yeah ... Woo, yeah! Ahhh, good times, good times. Hey, look!  Oh no ...  Soot. I've seen this before, right before my village was attacked. It's soot mixed with snow.   It's the Fire Nation. They've closed in on the North Pole and from the looks of this stuff, I'd say there's a lot of them.  What's wrong? We have to go!  What? We're just friends. You don't love him, do you? You don't even seem to like him.  You're not marrying them.>  Count me in!  Katara! Fire Navy uniforms don't look like that.  When, like, a hundred years ago?  The Fire Nation doesn't wear shoulder spikes anymore. The newer uniforms are more streamlined. His name is Zhao. Middle-aged, big sideburns, bigger temper ...  Princess Yue's marrying you?  Nothing. Congratulations.  Perks? What does that mean?  Princess Yue is wasted on a self-absorbed weasel like you!  You're just a jerk without a soul, no offense!  It's Admiral Zhao!  Oh, no. Hahn's out there on the top-secret mission while I'm here sharpening my boomerang. Everything's fine. What, you want me to scrub the barracks?  Oh ... Sure. That ... shouldn't be too hard. What happened? Where's Zuko?  Where did they go ... You did everything you could, and now we need to do everything we can to get him back. Zuko can't have gotten far. We'll find him. Aang's gonna be fine. Yip, yip. They're not going to die in this blizzard. If we know anything, it's that Zuko never gives up. They'll survive, and we'll find them. Hey, this is some quality rope! Sure we can. Let's go.  Yeah, this makes a lot of sense. Let's bring the guy who's constantly trying to kill us.  Are you okay? What do you mean? No! You don't have to do that.  I won't let you! Your father told me to protect you.  No! She's gone, she's gone. You must be proud.  Uggh! Sleep now. Temple later.  Ahh! Get it off! Get it off! Ahh!  Hey, stomach? Be quiet, all right? I'm trying> to find us some food.  Hey! Who ate all of my blubbered seal jerky?!  You what?! No wonder the flames smelled so good. So where do I get something to eat? I'm just a simple guy, with simple needs.  So uh, this airball game. How do you play?  Making him feel better is putting me in a world of hurt. Katara, check this out. We should tell him.  You know, you can't protect him forever.  Katara, firebenders were here. You can't pretend they weren't. Who's that?  And whoever's in there might have a medley of delicious cured meats! I don't suppose you have a key?  Statues? That's it? Where's the meat?  Past lives? Katara, you really believe in that stuff? You were a firebender? No wonder I didn't trust you when we first met.  You just couldn't get any weirder.  Firebender. Nobody make a sound.  That firebender won't know what hit him.  Dinner!  Not if I get him first! I want to eat you! Hey! No fair!  Hey, Aang! You find my dinner yet? Aang, I wasn't really going to eat the lemur, okay? Oh, man. Come on, Aang. Everything will be all right. Let's get out of here.  Aang! Come on! Snap out of it! Aaaaahh!  He found out firebenders killed Gyatso!  Well, do it! Before he blows us off the mountain!  Katara and I aren't going to let anything happen to you. Promise.  Can't talk! Must eat!  Come on! We've gotta get out of here! We need to split up. Take the tunnel and get to the stolen airship.  To Zuko! Who knew after all those times he tried to snuff us out, today he'd be our hero? What's with her?  What's with him?  Well, hello ... Uh, Zuko! Yes, why would I be expecting anyone different? So what's on your mind? Nah, she doesn't hate you. Katara doesn't hate anyone. Except maybe some people in the Fire Nation. No, I mean, uh, not people who are good, but used to be bad. I mean, bad people. Fire Nation people who are still bad, who've never been good and probably won't be, ever!  What? Why would you want to know that?  It's not a day I like to remember.  Many of the warriors had seen the black snow before and they knew what it meant: a Fire Nation raid. We were badly outnumbered, but somehow, we managed to drive them off. As quickly as they came, they just left. I was so relieved when it was over, but that's because I didn't know yet what had happened. I didn't know we had lost our mother. Yeah ... sea ravens. The main ship had flags with sea ravens on them.  No problem. Thanks for stopping by! I'd thought he'd never leave. Suki! Katara, she was my mother, too, but I think Aang might be right.  Katara! You know, you're pretty wise for a kid.  Usually it's annoying, but right now, I'm impressed. So, can I borrow Momo for a week?  What's going on? Did we get captured again?  Don't have to tell me twice.  You guys want to hear about my dream? That's okay. I didn't want to talk about it anyway.  Guys, wait. This was in my dream. We shouldn't go to the market.  Food eats people! Also, Momo could talk. You said some very unkind things. Out of food and out of money. Now what are we supposed to do?  Are you kidding? Shelter from what?  I'll go.  What? You said get a job ... and he's paying double>. I said I was going to do this job. I can't back out just because of some bad weather. Hey! They left without saying good-bye! I know! This one time, I was ... I'm too young to die! Seriously, you're still going to pay me, right? Do you hear that? It stopped raining.  Hey, you taking us down for a reason? Aang, why are we going down? Are you noticing now?  Is it telling you where we can get something to eat?  No offense to the swamp, but I don't see any land there to land on. Yes. See, even Appa and Momo don't like it here.  You better throw in an extra "yip"! We gotta move!  Where? Where?  Why do things keep attaching to me?!  We better speed things up.  Aang, these are just plants. Do you want me to say "please" and "thank you" as I swing my machete back and forth? I'm sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we don't wanna wind up getting eaten by them, we need to find Appa as fast as we can. There's no way they can hear us and no way we can see them. We'll have to make camp for the night. Nothing, just swamp gas. Look, there's nothing supernatural going on here.  I think we should build a fire. No, I asked the swamp. It said this was fine. Right, swamp? "No problem, Sokka!" Please, we're all alone out here.  Right, except for them. Aang! Stupid swamp! Dumb, ugly vines! Katara! You think you're so tough, huh? Hello? Yue? This is just a trick of the light ... swamp gas ... I ... hit my head running away last night. I'm going crazy.   What do you guys think you're doing!? I've been looking all over for you!  Well, there must be a tea party here and we just didn't get our invitations! Look, we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us. That's why we all saw things out here.  I thought I saw Yue. But, that doesn't prove anything. Look, I think about her all the time, and you saw Mom, someone you miss a lot. It's just a tree. It can't call anyone. For the last time, there's nothing after us and there's nothing magical happening here. There's someone in there! He's bending the vines! He's the Avatar. Stuff like that happens to us a lot. See, completely reasonable. Not a monster, just a regular guy defending his home. Nothing mystical about it.  Sure you did. It seems real chatty. Sorry to interrupt the lesson, but we still need to find Appa and Momo. Huu? Tastes just like arctic hen. So why were you guys so interested in eating Appa? You've got plenty of those big things wandering around. Nice Slim!  Well, I hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here. Just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp. I told you, we were hungry. I'm eating a giant bug! That's Avatar stuff, that doesn't count. The only thing I can't figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down. Well, no accounting for weather. Still, there's absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp. What's this?  Ahh, poetry.  I am so sorry. Something struck me in the rear. I just ... wound up ... here.  They call me Sokka, that is in the Water Tribe. I am not an oaf.  You think you're so smart, with your fancy little words, this is not so hard. I calls it easy. Like I paddle my canoe, I'll paddle yours too!   Squish, squash, sling that slang. I'm always right back at ya, like my ... boomerang!   That's right, I'm Sokka, it's pronounced with an "okka", young ladies, I rocked ya! Poetry ...  You have no idea where you're going, do you?  I guess we're getting close then.  Stop bugging her, airhead. You need to give girls space when they do their sewing.  Simple. Girls are better at fixing pants than guys and guys are better at hunting and fighting and stuff like that. It's just the natural order of things.  Wait! I was just kidding. I can't wear these! Katara, please! We just made a pit stop yesterday. Shouldn't we get a little more flying done before we camp out?  Yeah, that was real >convincing. Still, hard to argue with a ten-ton magical monster.  Are you kidding? The fish is doing all the work.  There's something in the water! Aang's in trouble. Aang! Get back here, Aang!  Well, let's not stick around to find out. Time to hit the road. Or, we could stay a while.  Show yourselves, cowards!  Who are you? Where are the men who ambushed us?  Wait a second, there's no way that a bunch of girls took us down. Not hungry.  They snuck up on me!  Sneak attacks don't count! Tie me up with ropes! I'll show them a thing or two. I'm not scared of any girls. Who do they think they are anyway? Mmm ... this is tasty.  I can't believe I got beat up by a bunch of girls.  Sorry ladies, didn't mean to interrupt your dance lesson. I was just looking for somewhere to get a little workout?  It's all right. I mean, normally I'd hold a grudge, but seeing as you guys are a bunch of girls, I'll make an exception.  True. But don't feel bad. After all, I'm the best warrior in my village.  Oh ... Well ... I mean ... I ... Well, if that's what you want, I'd be happy to. All right, you stand over there. Now, this may be a little tough, but try to block me.  Aw! Heh heh ... Good. Of course, I was going easy on you.  Let's see if you can handle this!  That does it!  Uh ... Hey, Suki.  No ... I ... well, let me explain.  I would be honored if you would teach me.  I'm sorry if I insulted you earlier. I was ... wrong.  Please make an exception. I won't let you down.  Of course!  Do I really have to wear this? It feels a little ... girly.  Bravery and honor. I think I'm starting to get it. Tah!  Hmm ...  I got you! Admit I got you!  Hey, I'm not a ... oh, whatever! I guess training's over. What about, "I'm sorry?"  I treated you like a girl when I should've treated you like a warrior.  I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?  I'd love to. Climb on everyone, Sokka's ready for take off.  And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.  We're finally here. Yeah ... she is ... Hi there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.  So ... uhhh ... you're a princess, huh? You know, back in my tribe, I'm kind of like a prince, myself.  A lot of things! Do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here. So, it looks like I'm going to be in town for a while. I'm thinking ... maybe we could ... do an activity, together? Princess Yue, good morning! How about that picnic last night? Boy, your dad sure does know how to throw a party. Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left. So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other. Yes ... at a place ... for some time. Great! I'll see you– Ah!   That's okay, it was worth it. See you tonight. Hi, Princess Yue. I made you something. I carved it myself. Actually, it's supposed to be a fish. See, it has a fin. No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it, one minute she wants to go out with me, and the next, she's telling me to get lost. So, how's waterbending training? Why don't you just teach her, Aang? I'm not happy. Yeah, I think she did. Are you crazy, Katara? You're not going to win this fight! Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful, and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me. No, no. See, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a Princess, and I'm ... I'm just a Southern peasant. It's okay. You don't have to say anything. I'll see you around, okay? Okay, now I'm really confused. Happy, but confused.  Would you sit down? If we hit a bump, you'll go flying off. What's bugging you anyway?  Well, let's see. You pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years. I'm sure you can master three more elements by next summer.  Maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in.  Nice puddle.  Great. So what am I supposed to do?  So, while you guys are playing in the water, I'm supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bison's feet? Okay.  Yeah, don't get too happy. You've got to do me next.   Aang?!   Yeah, I'll say! You just "practiced" our supplies down the river.  My life was hard enough when you were just an airbender.   We've got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that King Bumi gave us. Let's spend it wisely.  It doesn't even work. See? Even Momo thinks it's a piece of junk.  Wait a minute ... Sea loving traders, with suspiciously acquired merchandise, and pet reptile birds? You guys are pirates! Yeah, I was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection.  Whoa!  No wonder they were trying to hack us up! You stole their waterbending scroll! It doesn't matter. You put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid, fancy splashes.  Whatever. Ha, ha, ha! I'm sorry, but you deserved that. You've been duped; she's only interested in teaching herself. What about Momo? He's the real victim here. And what about me? There was that time you—  Huh? Where did she go? I don't believe it. She took the scroll! She's obsessed with that thing. It's just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep-  Oh, what? I'm not good enough to kidnap? Ah!  You're really gonna hand over the Avatar for a stupid piece of parchment? Sure is, and I'll bet he'll fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll. I'm just sayin' it's bad business sense. Think how much the Fire Lord would pay for the Avatar. You guys would be set for life.  Aang, are you there? Where? I can't find you! We'd need a team of rhinos to budge this ship. I don't know how. This thing wasn't made by the Water Tribe! Would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out? Have you lost your mind? This is no time for flute practice!  But we have another problem.  Yeah, we owe you one.   Is that really how you feel?  First, what did you learn?  You mean getting thoroughly spanked by the Fire Nation or having to walk all the way to the Western Air Temple? I miss not having blisters on my feet. Well, if you ask me, the new plan is the old plan! You just need to master all four elements and confront the Fire Lord before the comet comes. There's gotta be someone who can teach him firebending. Aang, I think we should be making some plans about our future! Not really, since you've followed us all over the world. Yeah, all you've ever done is hunt us down and try to capture Aang! He probably just covered himself in honey or something so that Appa would lick him. I'm not buying it. Like when you attacked our village?  Wait, you sent Combustion Man after us?  Ohhh, sorry. I didn't mean to insult your friend! Either you leave, or we attack. Obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap. He wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down, then he strikes. And you made us suck on frozen frogs? How could I forget? I had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month! I could feel it! It's my throatal flap! Yeah, face it Aang, you're nothing but a big prize to him.  Oh, hooray! In a lifetime of evil, at least he didn't add animal cruelty to the list. Or when he burned down Kyoshi Island! You're darn right you're not, buddy. I haven't seen her since she stormed off yesterday.  Let her have fun with her rocks. I'm in no rush to have her yelling at us again. Uhhh ...! So he attacked you? See? You trusted Zuko, and you got burned. Literally! Zuko's clearly too dangerous to be left alone. We're gonna have to go after him. He's crafty, but we'll find a way to capture him. Yeah, get him to come back and say he'll be our prisoner, then we'll jump him and really make him our prisoner. He'll never suspect it!   I know how to get an angle on him! All right buddy, don't fail me now!  Yeah, boomerang! Awww, boomerang ... Hey, what about me? I did the boomerang thing.  Hey, all I want is to defeat the Fire Lord. If you think this is the way to do it, then, I'm all for it. So, here you go, home sweet home, I guess, you know, for now. Unpack? Lunch, soon? Uhhh ... welcome aboard? Yeah. Okay, this is really, really weird.  Maybe you should give it a try.  It's like a scar ...  Listen. It's so quiet. There's no life anywhere.  Fire Nation! Those evil savages make me sick! They have no respect for -  What? I'm not allowed to be angry? The Avatar before you? He died over a hundred years ago; how are you supposed to talk to him?  Cheered me up. Ow. Yeah, I probably deserved that. Hey, who are you? Why is it attacking you?  Yeah. We're all going to get eaten by a spirit monster. This isn't right. We can't sit here and cower while Aang waits for some monster to show up. He still shouldn't have to face this alone. It doesn't seem too interested in what he's saying. Maybe we should go help him. That's it. He needs help.  Hei Bai, over here!  We'll fight him together, Aang. Aang! Over here! Help! What happened? Like I seriously need to use the bathroom.  You could give us some supplies, and some money. What? We need stuff. What is it? Creepy, but great.  I think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.  At least, not without your friends. We got your back. Ew!  Yeah! And it's gaining, fast! Can't you make Appa go any faster?  Let's run this blockade!   We got into the Fire Nation. Great.  No! I'm good. Refreshed and ready to fight some firebenders!   Well ... I was talking to Momo.   I don't see any guards.  Wait. I think I heard something. Do you know where you're going?  Firebenders aren't our friends!   Hey don't feel bad. You're only a hundred years late!   Five fire blasts, huh? I think I can help you out.  This is a little trick I picked up from my father. I seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing, Shyu lights the oil soaked twine and, ta-da! Fake firebending!  I don't get it. That firebending looked as strong as any firebending I've seen.  Come on Aang. Let her dream.  How are we gonna make it out of this?  We got your back. The day we have feared for so long has arrived. The Fire Nation is on our doorstep. It is with great sadness I call my family here before me, knowing well that some of these faces are about to vanish from our tribe, but they will never vanish from our hearts. Now, as we approach the battle for our existence, I call upon the great spirits. Spirit of the Ocean! Spirit of the Moon! Be with us! I'm going to need volunteers for a dangerous mission. Be warned, many of you will not return. Come forward to receive my mark, if you accept the task. The stillness before battle is unbearable. Such a quiet dread. Men, you'll be infiltrating the Fire Nation Navy. That means you'll all need one of these uniforms. Eighty-five. Sokka is from our sister tribe, Hahn. He's a capable warrior and I value his input. Now, our first objective is to determine the identity of their commanding officer. Sokka, I want you to tell everything you know to Hahn. He's leading this mission. Hahn, show Sokka your respect. I expect nothing less from my future son-in-law. That's enough! Sokka, you're off the mission! Is something wrong, Sokka? Listen to me. I took you off the mission for selfish reasons. I have a special task in mind for you. I want you to guard my daughter, Princess Yue. The spirits gave me a vision when Yue was born. I saw a beautiful, brave, young woman become the Moon Spirit. I knew this day would come. So proud ... and sad. Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe. And they have brought with them, someone very special, someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now ... the Avatar! We also celebrate my daughter's sixteenth birthday. Princess Yue is now of marrying age! Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform! Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.  What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student? I suspect he might change his mind, if you swallow your pride and apologize to him. Sokka?  Sokka! Katara! It is so good to see you two. You've grown so much!  No, he and the other warriors should be in the Eastern Earth Kingdom by now. This is no place for a reunion. Let's get inside. After I was wounded, your father carried me to this abbey. The sisters have cared for me ever since. Superior, these are Hakoda's children. They've been traveling with the Avatar. I found them by my boat.  The sisters craft ointments and perfumes. You have your father's wit. Help yourself! It was your father's idea, he just dragged me along. Well, the hippo did the dragging!   You knew about that? Not all of which were hilarious at the time, but everything's funny in hindsight. Hey, Aang! Please put that down, it's ceremonial and very fragile.  Your dad wore the octopus, but I did the spooky voice. There's something I should tell you kids. I'm expecting a message from your father.  Any day now. Your father said he'd send a message when they found the rendezvous point. If you wait until the message arrives, you can come with me, and see your father again. It's been far too long, hasn't it? I'm not sure when word will arrive, but when it does- I'm sure your father would understand, and be proud that his children are helping the Avatar. This ship is sentimental to me. It was built by my father. Yep! It's got the scar to prove it. Ha. How 'bout you Sokka? You must have some good stories from your first time ice dodging.  Oh, I forgot you were too young. It's a rite of passage for young Water Tribe members. When you turn fourteen, your dad takes you- You know what, you're about to find out! Ice dodging is a ceremonial test of wisdom, bravery, and trust. In our village, ice dodging was done by weaving a boat through a field of icebergs. You'll be dodging those. Sokka, you steer and call the shots, lead wisely. Katara, you secure the main sail. The winds can be brutal, so be brave. Aang, you control the jib. Without your steady hand, we all go down. Your position is about trust. For this is to be done right, I cannot help. You pass or fail on your own.  Sokka, you've already proven yourself. Maybe we should-  The spirits of water bear witness to these marks. For Sokka, the Mark of the Wise. The same mark your father earned. For Katara, the Mark of the Brave. Your courage inspires us. And for Aang, the Mark of the Trusted. You are now an honorary member of the Water Tribe. Well, Sokka. I think you should-  No, it's been separated from the pack. I understand that pain. It's how I felt when the Water Tribe warriors had to leave me behind. They were my family, and being apart from them was more painful than my wounds.  Your father will understand, and I know he's proud of you. I know where to go from here. Take this in case you want to find us. I'll leave a message at the rendezvous point. I'm sure Admiral Chan meant no disrespect, sir. I'll leave you two alone.   I just wish they would wear pants. Sokka, we're on our way to victory!  Your father invented tangle mines himself.  You're definitely your father's son.  What's your problem?  Of course they do. These are real uniforms captured from actual Fire Navy soldiers. How do we know we can trust this guy? Such bold talk for a new recruit.  Yeah, what of it?  Let me tell you Sokka, I've courted a lot of girls, but Yue is the finest and she comes with the most perks. I mean, Yue's nice and everything, but the points I'll gain with the chief aren't bad either.  Whoa, hang on. What do you care? You're just a simple rube from the Southern Tribe. What would you know of the political complexities of our life? No offense. All right, fall in men! Everybody listen to what I say and we'll take out this Admiral Chō in no time! Admiral Choi! Prepare to meet your fate! Sokka. You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.  Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most. And for you right now, that's here, protecting your sister. Someday you will. I'm gonna miss you so much. I heard what you two did. I am the proudest father in the world. And your mother would be proud, too.  Everything okay?  I'm Hakoda, Katara and Sokka's father.  I guess you're right. It's an honor to meet you. Of course.  We've been working on a modified version of the invasion plan. Yes, Sokka's plan. We won't be able to mount a massive invasion without the Earth King's armies, but the solar eclipse will still leave the Fire Nation vulnerable. Everyone just stay calm. Bato and I will take care of this. Actually, we're from the Eastern Fleet. We have orders to deliver some cargo. Next time, we'll send two hawks to make sure you get the message. What's wrong, Katara? What? Maybe that's his way of being brave. You're talking about me too, aren't you? I'm so sorry, Katara. I love you more than anything. You and your brother are my entire world. I thought about you every day when I was gone and every night when I went to sleep, I would lie awake missing you so much it would ache.  No.  If you take one step closer, you'll see just how "okay" I am.  Sokka, my son. You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut. The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here. But before I left, I met some young women who said they knew you. The ... Oshinama Fighters? That's right.  Good. We'll need all the help we can get. The son of the Fire Lord? I don't know him, but I know of him.  Sounds like a major problem. So, do you have a plan?  Sokka, there's no prison in the world that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.   I'll show you.  Aren't you mad at me?   Impressive. That's some girl. Wait! Who's that? I hope this thing floats. Sorry, warden. Your record is officially broken>.  Hi, Katara.  I did. But I'm a little worried, Sokka. Some of these men aren't exactly the "warrior type".  Is it just me, or are those fellas a little loose in the leaf-hat? Don't worry, you'll do great.  Thank you, Sokka. It's okay why don't you take a break? Let me just clarify a few points for everyone. Today, is the day of black sun, and I want to thank you all for your self-sacrifice, and your courage. There are two steps to the invasion, a naval stage, and then a land stage. To gain sea access to the Fire Nation capital, we need to get past our first major obstacle here, The Great Gates of Azulon. Next, we hit the land, and we hit hard. We must fight past their battlements and secure the plaza tower. Once we do that, it's up to the Royal Palace. At that point, the eclipse will begin. The eclipse only lasts eight minutes, not enough time for the whole invasion. And the Royal Palace is heavily guarded by firebenders. So that's where we'll need the eclipse's advantage the most. When this is finished, the Avatar will have defeated the Fire Lord. We will have control of the Fire Nation capital, and this war will be over! There they are, the Great Gates of Azulon. Katara, you and the swamp benders whip up a fog cover. Keep it up, we're almost through! Everyone below deck! Let's hope your invention works.  You've really outdone yourself this time, son. Everyone listen up. The next time we resurface, it'll be on the beaches. So stay alert, and fight smart. Now break time's over, back in the subs.  Everyone in position. Earthbenders, into your tanks. This is gonna be a rough ride. Ready the torpedo. Launch! Sokka, we've gotta take out those battlements! It's our only chance. You two take out that battlement. I got this one. Watch each other's backs.  Ah, a little, better. I need, to get back to the troops. Ahh! Everyone's counting on me to lead this mission Katara, I won't let them down. Ahh! You can do this. I'm proud of you son. Sokka. This bay leads directly to the outskirts of Ba Sing Se. We've been using these tangle mines to stop the Fire Nation ships from getting through. Very perceptive. The mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed. When a ship detonates the mine, the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship. I call it the "stink and sink." Bato, get these mines loaded up! The rest of you men, prepare for battle! Aren't you listening? I said, "The rest of you men, get ready for battle". Ready to go knock some Fire Nation heads?  Sokka, you don't have to prove anything to me. I'm already proud of you and I've always known you're a great warrior. Why do you think I trusted you to look after our tribe when I left? It'll be okay. It's not forever. Kya!  Hello, children. Sorry to frighten you. My name is Hama. You children shouldn't be out in the forest by yourselves at night. I have an inn nearby. Why don't you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds?  Aren't you sweet? You know you should be careful. People have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in.  When the moon turns full, people walk in and they don't come out. Who wants more tea? Don't worry, you'll all be completely safe here. Why don't I show you to your rooms and you can get a good night's rest?  Wakey, wakey! Time to go shopping!  You would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man? I think you and I are going to get along swimmingly! Why don't you take all those things back to the inn? I just have to run a couple more errands. I'll be back in a little while.  Mysterious town for mysterious children.  I'll tell you what's in the box. It's my greatest treasure. It's the last thing I own from growing up in the Southern Water Tribe.  Just like you. I heard you talking around your campfire. I wanted to surprise you! I bought all this food today so I could fix you a big Water Tribe dinner. Of course, I can't get all the ingredients I need here, but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough. Apology accepted. Now, let's get cooking! Who wants five flavor soup?  That's because the Fire Nation wiped them all out. I was the last one ...  I was stolen from my home.  It was over sixty years ago when the raids started.  They came again and again, each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive.  We did our best to hold them off, but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued.  Finally, I too was captured.  I was led away in chains. The last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe. They put us in terrible prisons here in the Fire Nation. I was the only one who managed to escape. I'm sorry. It's too painful to talk about anymore.  Oh, you poor things. I never thought I'd meet another Southern waterbender. I'd like to teach you what I know so you can carry on the Southern tradition when I'm gone. Growing up in the South Pole, waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas. But as you probably noticed on your travels, that isn't the case wherever you go.  That's why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists.  That's very resourceful, Katara. You're thinking like a true master. But did you know you could even pull water out of thin air? You have got to keep an open mind, Katara. There's water in places you never think about. They're called fire lilies. They only bloom a few weeks a year, but they're one of my favorite things about living here. And like all plants and all living things, they're filled with water. You can take it even further. They're just flowers. When you're a waterbender in a strange land, you do what you must to survive. Tonight I'll teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending. It can only be done during the full moon, when your bending is at its peak. Oh, Katara. Two master waterbenders beneath a full moon? I don't think we have anything to worry about. Can you feel the power the full moon brings? For generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow, allowing us to do incredible things!  I've never felt more alive. What I'm about to show you, I discovered in that wretched Fire Nation prison.  The guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us. They piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground. Before giving us any water, they would bind our hands and feet so we couldn't bend. Any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution. And yet each month, I felt the full moon enriching me with its energy. There had to be something I could do to escape. Then I realized that where there is life, there is water. The rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and I passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape. Bloodbending. Controlling the water in another body, enforcing your own will over theirs. Once I had mastered the rats, I was ready for the men.  And during the next full moon, I walked free for the first time in decades. My cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in. Once you perfect this technique, you can control anything or anyone.  The choice is not yours. The power exists. And it's your duty to use the gifts you've been given to win this war. Katara, they tried to wipe us out, our entire culture, your mother!  Then you should understand what I'm talking about! We're the last two waterbenders of the Southern Tribe. We have to fight these people whenever we can, wherever they are, with any means necessary!  They threw me in prison to rot, along with my brothers and sisters! They deserve the same! You must carry on my work!  You should've learned the technique before you turned against me! It's impossible to fight your way out of my grip! I control every muscle, every vein in your body!  Aahhh! No! You've outnumbered yourselves.  Don't hurt your friends, Katara! And don't let them hurt each other! My work is done. Congratulations, Katara. You're a bloodbender.  Katara, you shouldn't have gone on that ship! Now we could all be in danger!  Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.  Katara, you'll feel better after you-   What do you two think you're doing?  You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you. It's been so long since I've had hope, but you brought it back to life, my little waterbender. And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister. Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance. You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his. Well, no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years. We thought they were extinct, until my granddaughter and grandson found you.  Call me Gran-Gran. All right, no more playing. Come on, Katara, you have chores.  Katara, try not to put all your hopes in this boy. Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?  I am Avatar Kuruk. When I was young, I was always a go-with-the-flow kind of Avatar. People seemed to work out their own problems, and there was peace and good times in the world. But then, I lost the woman I loved to Koh, the Face Stealer. It was my fault. If I had been more attentive and more active, I could've saved her. Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny and the destiny of the world.  Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want. Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this. Just let her go and I'll give you the information you want. Go find your dad, sweetie. I'll handle this. There are no waterbenders here. The Fire Nation took them all away a long time ago. If I tell you, do you promise to leave the rest of the village alone? It's me. Take me as your prisoner.  It is respectful to bow to an old master, but how about a hug for your new grandfather? I made her a new betrothal necklace and everything.  You can still just call me Pakku.  No.   It came from a Grand Lotus: your uncle, Iroh of the Fire Nation.   Katara, I want you to have this. This amulet contains water from the Spirit Oasis. The water has unique properties. Don't lose it.  Aang, these scrolls will help you master waterbending. But remember, they're no substitute for a real master. Sokka ... take care, son. Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom base to the east of here. General Fong will provide you with an escort to Omashu. There, you will be safe to begin your earthbending training with King Bumi.  Nice try, Pupil Sangok. A couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge. Would anyone care for a rematch with Katara? Katara, you've advanced more quickly than any student I've ever trained. You have proven that with fierce determination, passion and hard work, you can accomplish anything. Raw talent alone is not enough. Pupil Aang!  Care to step into the sparring circle? I figure since you've found time to play with house pets, you must have already mastered waterbending.  Stop those fireballs! I've decide to go to the South Pole. Some other benders and healers want to join me. It's time we helped rebuild our sister tribe. Well, then he better get used to calling you Master Katara. Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment. If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.  No, please, march right in. I'm not concentrating or anything. I'm sorry, I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending. No. Here, the women learn from Yagoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student, despite your bad attitude. I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules. Then what? Well, have fun teaching yourself! I'm sure you'll do a great job. Why don't we get started, then?  You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.  Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one? You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture. You are no longer welcome as my student. I'm waiting, little girl. Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong. Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad? Study closely! Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you! Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender. No. This fight is over. Yes, you are. This is my necklace ... I made this sixty years ago for the love of my life ... for Kanna. I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her. Not bad, not bad. Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age. What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise. You're late.  You didn't protect me.  But I gotta ...  I gotta pee! But I really gotta go!  Ahhh! Aang, don't go! I'll miss you! Sokka, good to see you. Are you here for the healing lesson? Welcome ... welcome! So, who's the lucky boy? Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right? I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner; you're the spitting image of Kanna! When I was about your age, I was friends with Kanna. She was born here in the Northern Tribe. Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her. I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye. I'm going to find Mom!  I'm going to find Mom. Mom! Mommy, I'm scared.  Dad, Dad! Please, I think Mom's in trouble! There's a man in our house!  Mommy, I'm scared. You already saved the world. And you'll save the world again, but you can't give up. The legend said the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides, and learned how to do it themselves. So they don't have palaces in the Southern Tribe?  Sokka, this is wrong.  I'm engaged. It just feels ...  Who? Looks like you haven't been giving Appa enough attention!  So, how does this work?  Oh ... my ... goodness! Wow, I can't believe you do this every day. Is it always this cold in the sky?   It's beautiful up here.  What's happening? What? But, why?  No, Sokka, wait, I can't see you anymore. Not at all. I wish we could just be friends, but I like you too much and it's too confusing to be around you. I'm marrying someone else!  But I do love my people.  You don't understand. I have duties to my father, to my tribe. I have to do this. Goodbye. They've stopped firing.  But, you have to. You're the Avatar.  The legends say the moon was the first waterbender. Our ancestors saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves. Our strength comes from the spirit of the moon. Our life comes from the spirit of the ocean. They work together to keep balance. How can you do that?  Maybe they'll give you the wisdom to win this battle! I have an idea. Follow me.  No. You'll have to get there on your own. But I can take you to the most spiritual place in the entire North Pole.  It's the center of all spiritual energy in our land. Why is he sitting like that? Is there any way we can help?  Is he okay? Maybe we should get some help. Don't worry, Prince Zuko can't be getting too far in this weather. I feel faint.  I owe the Moon Spirit my life.  When I was born I was very sick and very weak. Most babies cry when they're born, but I was born as if I was asleep, my eyes closed. Our healers did everything they could. They told my mother and father I was going to die. My father pleaded with the spirits to save me. That night, beneath the full moon, he brought me to the oasis and placed me in the pond. My dark hair turned white. I opened my eyes and began to cry, and they knew I would live. That's why my mother named me Yue. For the moon.  There's no hope now, it's over. Yes, you're right. It gave me life, maybe I can give it back. It's my duty, Sokka.  I have to do this. Goodbye, Sokka. I'll always be with you. Thank you, Father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times!  Very nice to meet you.   Do an activity? I'm happy you enjoyed yourself. Do an activity, you mean?  I'd love to. I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.   Sorry. It's a bear. Oh. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I shouldn't have asked you to come here.  What do you want from me? You don't understand. No, Sokka ... I do like you, a lot. But we can't be together, and not for the reason you think. It's because ... I'm engaged. I'm sorry.
