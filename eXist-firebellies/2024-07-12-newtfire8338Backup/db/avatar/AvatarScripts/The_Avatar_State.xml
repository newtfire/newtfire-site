      <description>The episode opens to show a gray sky as the camera moves back and down
                toward the Southern Air Temple where Aang is caught in a dream. In it, he is running
                about the Southern Air Temple. He comes across the room where he had found Monk
                Gyatso's skeleton in real life and instead sees his own self in the Avatar State.
                The personage of himself turns to glare at him angrily. Camera cuts to a terrified
                Aang, wind blowing past him. Cuts to a view of Sokka and Katara huddled behind a
                rock, watching the Avatar State Aang as he sends a forceful gust of wind that blows
                the real Aang back. He falls into the room in the Fire Temple he had visited to
                speak to Roku. The doors to the room open and reveal the personage of Aang in the
                Avatar State, who breathes fire and splits the floor in half. The real Aang falls
                through and lands on a Fire Navy ship in the Northern seas. The monstrous koi fish,
                called Koizilla, created when he and La had fused together during the Siege of the
                North appears before him, the personage of him inside. The Kozilla makes a downward
                cutting motion, and the personage does the same before a blinding white appears and
                the dream ends. Aang awakes from it and leaves the room where the gang is sleeping,
                exiting through a stairway. Katara awakens and catches sight of him
                leaving.</description>

      <description>The camera cuts to a shot of Aang standing by the ledge of the Water Tribe
                ship on which they are sailing. Katara approaches him.</description>

      <speech speaker="Katara">Do you want to talk about it?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Nah, just a nightmare. I was in the Avatar State, but I was outside my body watching
            myself. It was scary. I was scary. <charAction>Closes eyes and bows his head; Katara
                puts her hand on his shoulder.</charAction>

                massage at a resort.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">This is what I've been missing. Who knew floating on a piece of driftwood for three
            weeks with no food or water, and sea vultures waiting to pluck out your liver could make
            one so tense? <charAction>Looks at the clearly unhappy Zuko, walks over to him, and sits
                down on the ground.</charAction> I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>In a brooding tone.</charAction> Three years ago today, I was banished.
            I lost it all. <charAction>Looks up.</charAction> I want it back. I want the Avatar, I
            want my honor, my throne. I want my father not to think I'm worthless. <charAction>Looks
                on regretfully.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">I'm sure he doesn't. Why would he banish you if he didn't care? <charAction>Zuko
                gets up and walks away; he grimaces soon after; to the massagers.</charAction> Uh,
            that came out wrong, didn't it? <charAction>They look at each other in
                confusion.</charAction>

      <description>The scene switches to a Fire Nation ship. Several men bow as a royal
                carriage is brought out. Within the carriage is Princess Azula, the daughter of
                Ozai, niece of Iroh, and sister of Zuko.</description>

      <speech speaker="Azula">
         <charAction>Stepping out of the carriage and walking down the line of
                soldiers.</charAction> My brother and my uncle have disgraced the Fire Lord, and
            have brought shame on all of us. You might have mixed feelings about attacking members
            of the Royal Family. I understand. But I assure you, if you hesitate, I will not
            hesitate to bring you down. Dismissed.</speech>

      <description>The soldiers leave. The captain runs up to Azula.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Captain">Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not allow us to bring the ship into port before
            nightfall.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">I'm sorry, captain, but I do not know much about the tides. Could you explain
            something to me?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">You said the tides would not allow us to bring the ship in. <charAction>In a sharper
                tone.</charAction> Do the tides command this ship?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Captain">No, princess.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">And if I were to have you thrown overboard, would the tides think twice about
            smashing you against the rocky shore?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Captain">
         <charAction>Worried.</charAction> No, princess.</speech>

         <charAction>Runs fingers through her bangs.</charAction> Well then, maybe you should
            worry less about the tides who have already made up their mind about killing you, and
            worry more about me, who's still mulling it over. <charAction>Turns to face the captain
                angrily.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Captain">I'll pull us in.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He leaves. Cuts to a close-up of Azula, who glares and narrows her eyes in
                suspicion. The scene switches to the team flying on Appa.</description>

      <description>The scene cuts to inside the base, where General Fong and the team are
                sitting in a spacious discussion room.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fong">
         <charAction>Camera view depicts entire room.</charAction> Avatar Aang, we were all
            amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire Fire Navy fleet at
            the North Pole. <charAction>Closes up to Fong, stroking his beard.</charAction> I can't
            imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power. It's an awesome
            responsibility.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Casually.</charAction> I try not to think about it too much.</speech>

         <charAction>Shocked.</charAction> What? No I'm not!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Holds out her hand in reasoning.</charAction> Aang still needs to master
            all four elements.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fong">Why? With the kind of power he possesses, power enough to destroy hundreds of battle
            ships in a matter of minutes, he could defeat the Fire Lord now!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">But sir, the thing is, Aang can only do those things when he's in the Avatar
            State.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">See, it's this special state where-</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fong">
         <charAction>Sharply.</charAction> I'm well aware! Your eyes and tattoos glow and
            you're able to summon unbelievable power. Without you, we'd be slaughtered before we
            even reach their shores. <charAction>Looks at map and guides finger from the location of
                the base to the location of the Fire Nation Capital.</charAction> But with you
            leading the way, as the ultimate weapon, we could cut a swath right through to the heart
            of the Fire Nation.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Doubtfully.</charAction> Right, but, I don't know how to get in or out
            of the Avatar State, much less what to do once I'm there.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fong">So, it's decided then. I'll help you figure out how to get into the Avatar State and
            then you'll face your destiny.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>The group rises; angrily.</charAction> No, nothing's decided. We already
            have a plan. Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fong">Well, while you take your time learning the elements, the War goes on. May I show
            you something? <charAction>Leads Aang to a window.</charAction> That's the infirmary,
            and those soldiers are the lucky ones. <charAction>Several soldiers are injured and
                walking slowly.</charAction> They came back. Every day, the Fire Nation takes lives.
            People are dying, Aang! You could end it, now. Think about it.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Aang averts his eyes to the side, looking unsure. The scene changes to
                Azula's ship, where she is training. She stands perfectly straight, holding her
                fingers in her hand. The camera cuts to where Lo and Li are sitting, overseeing her
                training. Cuts to shot of Azula, as she moves her arms in a circular motion,
                generating lightning and firing the bolt into the sky.</description>

   <section>
      <description>She repeats her actions, generating lightning again and firing it off into
                the distance. Cuts to a shot of Iroh, who suddenly awakens from a nap, sits up and
                peers in curiosity. The scene changes to nightfall at Fong's base.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Rises and throws her hands up in surrender.</charAction> If you two meat

   <section>
      <description>Aang casts a mournful look. The scene changes to the next day where Fong,
                the team, and another soldier are sitting in an outdoor room. The soldier is pouring
                tea in a cup.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Soldier">
         <charAction>Drops white food item into the teapot.</charAction> This rare
            chi-enhancing tea is a natural stimulant. In an ordinary warrior, it improves strength

      <speech speaker="Aang">Ten-fold energy, huh?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang drinks the tea, causing his eyebrows to twitch slightly. The camera
                pans downward to the same scene where Aang is riding rapidly on an air scooter,
                hyper from the energy boost.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Quickly in a high-pitched voice.</charAction> Is it working? Is it
            working? I can't tell! Somebody tell me if I'm in the Avatar State 'cause I don't have a

      <speech speaker="Sokka">

      <speech speaker="Aang">I love surprises!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Camera cuts to view from Aang's perspective, Katara covering his eye with
                her hands. She uncovers his eyes to reveal Sokka towering over Aang, his head
                instead replaced with Momo's, who screeches. Aang screams and glances at his arrow
                tattoos.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cuts to view of the entire team as Sokka steps backward, loses his balance
                and falls to the ground off camera. Fong shakes his head in dismay. The scene
                changes to a dimly lit room where Aang is standing, wearing an outfit consisting of
                a Water Tribe cloak, an Earth Kingdom hat with leaves coming out of the top, part of
                a Fire Nation soldier outfit and what appears to be a belt.</description>

      <description>The scene changes to Zuko and Iroh's place of stay, the room dark inside.
                Several various shells fall from a bag onto the table. The camera pans up to where
                Iroh is standing at the table, picking up and examining the different

      <description>Zuko walks away, leaving Iroh saddened. Meanwhile, Aang is caught in
                another dream. The dream takes place in the Southern seas on Zuko's ship, where the
                Avatar State Aang rises from the water, riding a water vortex, similar to the way
                Aang did in the beginning of the series. The personage lands on deck and sweeps away
                the real Aang with waterbending. The personage turns to Zuko and performs the same
                downward, cutting motion as seen in previous dreams before the dream abruptly ends
                and Aang awakens.</description>

      <description>The camera focuses on soldiers, who prepare to fire large earth coins at
                Aang using earthbending. Cuts to a shot of Aang, looking nervously about him. The
                camera zooms out to a shot of him and his attackers before switching to a soldier,
                who sends an earth coin at him. Aang avoids two oncoming coins and soars in the air
                parallel to the ground between two more coins that are thrown at him. He lands
                safely to the ground.</description>

         <charAction>Looking about cautiously.</charAction> I'm not your enemy! I won't fight

   <section>
      <description>He jumps into the air as four earth coins are sent his way, crashing into
                each other. As Aang begins his descent, another earth coin is sent skidding toward
                him; the coin crashes into one of the four stationery coins. Aang lands on the
                ground where the coin was standing just moments ago. Two of the other stationery
                coins are closed together. The camera cuts to a shot of Aang trapped inside the
                holes of the earth coins, rolling speedily away. An earthbender breaks the coins,
                crumbling them to bits. Aang lands on the ground, rises and faces the rest of the
                soldiers.</description>
      <description>Meanwhile, Sokka, who was being held down by the two soldiers, raises his
                feet and steps on their bare feet forcefully. The two soldiers release their grip
                and fall forward onto the ground in pain while Sokka runs away to aid
                Aang.</description>
      <description>Outside, Aang narrowly avoids two earth coins sent at him, one flying above
                him, one flying below him. Two more earth coins are sent from opposite sides of the
                ring, threatening to crush him. Aang manages to escape by dodging through the holes
                in the coins just as they collide together and fall to the ground.</description>
      <description>Riding an air scooter, Aang zigzags past several soldiers who attempt to
                slow him down by conjuring up rock walls in his path. Two soldiers riding ostrich
                horses chase after him as Aang rides past and scales up the wall of the base. As he
                is seen riding up the wall on the air scooter, the two soldiers use earthbending to
                propel themselves upward. Aang's air scooter runs out of air and he begins running
                up the wall, the two soldiers following him in hot pursuit. Cuts to a top view of
                Aang scaling the wall, only to narrowly dodge two spears coming his
                way.</description>
      <description>He falls to the ground. The two soldiers land on the wall and descend to
                the ground after him. Aang somersaults forward as he avoids their spear attacks yet
                again. He lands onto the ground, an earth coin embedded into it. The earth coin is
                suddenly sent upward and dragged forward, Aang being trapped in its hole. The earth
                coin lands in front of Fong.</description>

      <description>Fong leaps forward and crushes the earth coin, just as Aang jumps to avoid
                the attack. Dust from the impact is sent flying toward the screen. The scene changes
                to where Zuko and Iroh are approaching Azula's ship. The camera pans upward and
                focuses on a shot of Azula standing quietly on top of a ramp leading up to the ship.
                Royal Procession guards stand on either side of them as they walk, forming an aisle.
                Iroh averts his eyes suspiciously between the guards. They reach the ship and bow;
                the guards behind them walk forward and close the aisle.</description>

                Azula. Zuko and Iroh stop, looking surprised. Cut to Azula with a look of surprise
                on her face. The camera rushes to her face as her expression turns to fury. Cut back
                to the captain, his eyes wide.</description>

                edge of the walkway and sends fire blasts their way. Cuts to a side-shot of Zuko, as
                he stomps furiously up the ramp and throws the captain off.</description>

      <description>She turns her back to him and walks away, as two guards standing near her
                shoot fire blasts at Zuko. Zuko crosses his arms and spreads them outward,
                deflecting the attacks and shouts as he charges onto the ship. The scene changes to
                Aang, who avoids three earth coins that slam onto the ground, threatening to crush
                him. He runs to the left of the screen as another coin rolls his way. The scene
                changes to the team's bedroom, where Katara is lying on her bed, listening to the
                noises outside.</description>

      <description>She rises from her bed. The camera cuts to a shot of the base tower and

                shot of a soldier, who is hit by the boomerang and falls to the ground in a daze,
                knocking over the earth coin in the process. Cuts to Aang, who is being chased by
                another soldier mounted on an ostrich horse. The head of the spear the soldier was
                holding is suddenly snapped off. He slows down, stunned at this. Cuts to a shot of
                Katara summoning a water whip.</description>

      <description>The soldiers rotate the earth coins so that their flat sides face Katara.
                The camera zooms out to the entire arena, the coins forming a triangular pattern
                around Katara. The waterbender sends a water whip at Fong, who summons up dust
                pillars that deflect the water and turn it to mud. He uses earthbending to begin
                sinking her into the ground. She twists around, buried knee deep.</description>

                to save her, however, he falls short. Closes up on Aang, as his arrow tattoo begins
                to glow a bright white. He turns his head to face Fong, the Avatar State now
                triggered.</description>

      <description>An air blast is sent his way and his triumphant expression soon becomes one
                of fear as he realizes the situation. Cuts to Aang, who performs the downward
                cutting motion as seen in his previous dreams and pushes Fong back with a powerful
                air blast. Fong lands roughly on the ground. Cuts to Aang, who begins rising on an
                earth vortex.</description>
      <description>The scene changes to Zuko, who leaps onto the deck of the ship and blasts
                the two guards off the ship with two fire blasts. He lands on deck. The camera zooms
                out to where Azula is standing patiently several feet away, her back turned to him.
                Focuses on Azula, who smirks. Cuts to Zuko, who clenches his fists and prepares fire
                daggers. Cuts to Iroh, who continues to attack the guards on the
                walkway.</description>

      <description>He hurls the guard over the edge and steps to the side to avoid another

                daggers. Zooms out to where he attempts to strike Azula, only for the princess to
                acutely dodge all of his blows. Cuts to close-up of her as she smirks at her
                brother. Zooms out to both siblings as Zuko keeps attacking and Azula keeps
                avoiding. Zuko brings down his right hand to land another blow, however, Azula
                manages to push him away.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko conjures up two fire daggers again. He leaps into the air and sends a
                powerful fire blast at Azula using his foot. She jumps and lands safely on the deck
                several feet away. Zuko charges at her as she rises to her feet. After dodging
                several more attacks, she manages to scrape his forehead with her fingernails,
                leaving three scratch marks on his temple. Zuko falls back a few feet from the
                impact and yells as he charges at her again.</description>
      <description>The two continue to duel, eventually making their way up a stairway that
                leads to the central control area of the ship. Azula manages grab hold of Zuko's
                arm. A few seconds pause as the two stand silently, Zuko widening his eyes in alarm.
                Cuts to a side-shot of the stairway where Azula knocks him to his feet with a blue
                fire blast. Zuko lands roughly at the bottom of the stairwell. Cuts to a shot from
                Zuko's perspective, the screen slightly blurred to show the effects of the blow. The
                camera travels upward from side to side before landing on Azula, who moves both her
                arms in a circular motion, generating lightning. Cuts to shot of her readying the
                attack and firing the bolt at her brother, only for Iroh to step in suddenly, grab
                hold of her right hand and redirect the lightning, causing it to strike a far-off
                cliff side. He bends her downward and kicks her off the ship. Azula lands in the
                water below with a splash. Cuts to Zuko and Iroh, who run away from the
                ship.</description>
      <description>The scene changes to Fong's base, where Aang is rising on the earth vortex,
                still under the control of the Avatar State.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang swivels about on the vortex and lands on the ground forcefully,
                causing a flurry of dust to spread. Fong is sent back several feet while Katara
                remains rooted to the ground where she was. Cuts to the left of the arena where
                several soldiers are standing, a torrent of dust rumbling their way. The dust clears
                to reveal the ground broken and in ruins. Cuts to right of the arena, where several
                soldiers on ostrich horses stand. The dust torrent passes over them and clears,
                revealing that side in ruins. Cuts to another area of the base, where several houses
                lie. Again, the torrent passes over, leaving the houses considerably
                damaged.</description>
      <description>Cuts to Aang, who is still under the influence of the Avatar State. His
                spirit is seen leaving his body and rising into the air. Cuts to bird's-eye view of
                the base as Roku's dragon, Fang passes by, Avatar Roku and Aang riding atop the

                eyes glow for a moment and she assumes a fighting stance. The camera zooms out to
                reveal two large earthen statues, somewhat resembling badgermoles. She performs a
                series of moves which cause the statues to rise into the air, and send them past

                tsunami-like wave. He is seen rapidly riding atop the wave toward the screen. Cuts
                to Avatar Yangchen, who stands in a grassy field surrounded by a forest area. Her
                eyes glow briefly as she swings her arms and swivels around, conjuring powerful
                winds. The camera zooms out to the entire field and the forest blown violently by
                the wind.</description>

                Fang flies downward, head first, passing through Aang's body and into the ground.
                Aang's spirit is brought back to his physical self and he exits the Avatar

                at it for a moment before passing the knife to Iroh, who cuts off his topknot. Cuts
