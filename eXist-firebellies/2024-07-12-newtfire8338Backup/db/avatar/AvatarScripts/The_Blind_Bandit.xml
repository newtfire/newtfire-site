      <description>The camera pans across a wide-view over Gaoling. Town citizens move through
                the streets. The team stands inside a shop. The camera zooms in on them, gathered
                around a green bag. Sokka is looking at the bag while pondering. Katara and Momo on
                her shoulder look at him. Aang sits down, looking the other way and wearing his
                conical hat.</description>

            But no, it's too expensive. I shouldn't.</speech>

      <description>In the background, a town citizen tries to talk to a passer-by, showing him
                a flyer.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">All right, then don't.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara walks away in boredom. Aang gets up and follows her. Sokka pauses
                for a moment and goes along, too, his eyes still on the bag as he moves out of view.
                The town citizen with the flyers walks away into the same direction. Sokka quickly
                comes back into view.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Enthusiastically.</charAction> You know what? I'm gonna get it.

      <description>Aang, Katara, and Momo wait down the street. The town citizen turns toward
                them, showing them the flyer.</description>

      <speech speaker="Flyer distribution man">Psst, psst! Hey, you kids love earthbending? You like ... throwing rocks? Then check
            out Master Yu's Earthbending Academy.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The flyer distribution man hands over a flyer with a broad smile. The shot
                switches to a close-up of the flyer as Aang, Katara, and Momo look at it. Aang turns
                it around.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Look! There's a coupon on the back! The first lesson is free.</speech>

      <description>The camera zooms out, showing Aang, Katara, and Momo looking at the
                flyer.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Who knows? This Master Yu could be the earthbending teacher you've been looking
            for.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka joins them, holding the green bag. He looks wondering at the flyer.
                Scene cuts to Yu's academy. The camera shows a short view of the entrance. Aang
                looks perplexed, wearing an Earth Kingdom outfit and a green hat. He puts his finger
                into his ear, wiggles it and sniffs his finger. Turning to his right, he sees that
                all the younger children with whom he is standing in line with sport a serious
                expression and he promptly straightens his back. Their teacher, Master Yu, moves
                toward his two opposing rows of pupils. The row opposite of Aang has rocks placed in
                front of them.</description>

      <speech speaker="Yu">Take your stances! <charAction>His students take their fighting stances, except for
                Aang.</charAction> Now, strike as if you're punching through your opponent's
            head!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Yu demonstrates the movement he means. The pupils lift their rocks. A
                close-up shows Aang's startled expression. The camera shifts to a close-up of the
                student that stands across Aang as he fires his rock at him. Aang gets hit by the
                rock in the gut and smashes into a vase in the shape of a tea pot by the impact of
                the blow.</description>

      <speech speaker="Yu">
         <charAction>Approaches Aang.</charAction> So, are you ready to commit to more
            lessons? If you pay for the whole year in advance, I'll bump you up to the next
            belt!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang stares at him, covered in sand and shards. Only his eyes, nose and
                right hand are visible. The sand shifts and covers his face completely. Moments
                later, Aang walks out of the academy with the other students and returns to Katara
                and Sokka.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Ehhh, he's not the one. <charAction>Beats his right ear, causing sand to fall out of

      <description>The students laugh and walk away as he looks on disappointed. Sokka walks
                up to Aang laughing while Katara glares at them while walking up.</description>

            buy this?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He puts the bag down and crosses his arms in front of his chest. Momo hops
                off his shoulder, into the bag. He turns around inside of it and settles down,
                closing his eyes. Katara comes running back.</description>

      <description>A scene shows the two students frozen together at the head, encased in ice
                in an alley. Nightfall. The camera shows the entrance to location of Earth Rumble
                VI: a lighted tunnel in a rock face. People enter the tunnel. The camera shows the
                hall where the competition will be held. A large rectangular arena is located in the
                middle. The arena has stairs running down to a lower, oval shaped area. Seats for
                the spectators start at the same level as the arena. Team Avatar walks into an empty
                row of seats.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Hey, front row seats! I wonder why no one else is sitting here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They sit down but quickly jump back up as a huge rock smashes into the
                seats next to them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I guess that's why.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>In the center of the ring, the event's host raises an earthen platform. He
                brings it back to the level of the rest of the arena.</description>

      <speech speaker="Xin Fu">

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Sighs and looks the other way.</charAction> This is just going to be a

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Happily.</charAction> That's what I paid for.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Xin Fu">The rules are simple. Just knock the other guy out of the ring, and you win!
                <charAction>Leaps up to a podium above the ring. A bell rings.</charAction> Round
            one: The Boulder vs. The Big Bad Hippo! <charAction>While Xin Fu speaks, The Boulder
                raises his arms and turns around to the cheering of the audience. The Hippo
                roars.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="The Boulder">
         <charAction>Pointing at The Hippo.</charAction> Listen up, Hippo. You may be big,
            but you ain't bad! <charAction>Grinning insanely.</charAction> The Boulder's gonna win
            this in a landslide!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="The Hippo">Hippo ... mad!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The Hippo raises his arms in anger and stomps one foot. Momo lowers himself
                more inside Sokka's bag out of fear. The Boulder fires three rocks. They crash into
                The Hippo, but he does not move. He catches one piece of rock with his mouth, chews
                on it and spits it out. The Hippo jumps up and down, causing the surface of the
                arena to tilt. The Boulder hereby loses his balance.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Xin Fu">Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen! The Hippo is rocking the boat!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The Boulder reaches the edge, but saves himself by bending out part of the
                ring into a small platform. He grabs it and throws it at his opponent, hitting him
                on the back. As The Hippo turns around to look at him, The Boulder bends up The
                Hippo's part of the ring, and throws him out on it. The Hippo crashes in the lower
                area of around the arena. The fight ends thus in his favor.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Shrugs.</charAction> I don't know. Bumi said I need a teacher who
            listens to the earth. He's just listening to his big muscles. What do you think,
            Sokka?</speech>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Far off side-shot as the crowd boos at the Fire Nation Man who is making
                his way over to the arena, still waving his flag, on a makeshift earthen bridge,
                which crumbles away behind him. Cut to a close-up of Sokka, who loudly boos the
                fighter as well, while giving him a thumbs down.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The crowd boos at him again while bombarding him with pieces of rock, much
                to his surprise. Cut to Sokka with a stone cocked back in his hand, ready to
                throw.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Sokka throws his rock. Cut to a close-up of the Fire Nation Man, who is hit
                against the head by a rock. He starts to become angry, though the emotion quickly
                changes to wonder and he is sunk chest-deep into the ground; he drops his flag in
                the process. Cut to a shot from over his shoulder to reveal The Boulder as the
                culprit, who subsequently raises himself high into the air on an earth pillar. Cut
                to a close-up of the Fire Nation Man, who looks petrified.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Fire Nation Man">No, no, please!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a close-up of The Boulder grinning broadly. He leaps in the air, his
                face serious. Cut to a side-shot; The Boulder is plummeting straight down, his feet
                held back behind his back as to direct his knees to the ground. Switch to a further
                off shot as he slams the surface of the ring, by which he creates a pillar under
                Fire Nation Man that catapults him out of the ground. Frog-view shot of the Fire
                Nation Man as he sails screaming through the air. Cut to a frontal shot of the place
                where Team Avatar is sitting. The Fire Nation Man smacks upside down and face first
                against the large boulder that was embedded into the stand next to team Avatar.
                Sokka gets up and waves both hands in the air in celebration of the Fire Nation
                Man's defeat, while shouting in the fighter's direction.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Yeah! Wooo! <charAction>Points at Fire Nation Man.</charAction> The Boulder knows

   <section>
      <description>Cut to the arena where a man riding a badgermole is going over the surface
                to make it smooth again, letting the animal bend all the rubble away. A turning,
                frog-view shot reveals the ceiling and a female assistant holding up a sign to
                announce the next round as a bell is struck. A montage shows The Boulder defeating
                several more fighters: The Gopher gets slammed between two rocks, The Gecko jumps
                up, but gets hit in the stomach by a broad earthen pillar, Headhunter gets hit with
                an earthen coin. Between his victories, The Boulder entertains the cheering crowd by
                wobbling his chest. As The Boulder relishes from his fans' praise, there is a faded
                scene with the crowd cheering with Sokka soon appearing in front. Far off shot of
                Xin Fu standing on his platform.</description>

   <section>
      <description>As Xin Fu was speaking, the girl raises her championship belt above her
                head, under loud cheering of the crowd. Cut to a further off frontal shot, showing
                the girl to actually be a short child, barely reaching to the waists of the female
                assistants standing next to her. As the spotlight dies down, the girl offers her
                championship belt to the assistant on her right, while the other one removes her
                cape, and they both walk off. The camera shifts to Aang and Katara.</description>

      <description>Sokka's movement causing Aang to flinch back and Momo to coo and hide in
                the bag Sokka bought earlier on the market. Cut to a shot of the Blind Bandit that
                nearly instantly moves back to a view from on the arena's floor level. The Boulder
                confidently puts his foot in the middle of the screen, cracking the floor in the
                process and throwing up some dust. Cut to a frog-point frontal view of the
                fighter.</description>

      <description>Cut back to a close-up of Aang, before switching to a flashback from "The
                Swamp" where he saw the girl in white and the flying boar. He remembers her laugh,
                which is the same as that of the Bandit. The flashback shows a closer shot of the
                girl in the fancy dress. The camera closes in and turns around the girl to reveal
                her face as the Bandit's. The flashback ends in a flash of white to reveal Aang's
                stunned face.</description>

      <description>Cut back to a shot from behind The Boulder who faces the Bandit, before
                shifting to a tilting down shot of The Boulder's head. Despite his bravado, he is
                sweating profusely. Switch to a frontal shot of the Bandit. The camera whirls around
                her head and ends with a close up shot of her ear. Cut to The Boulder, who yells and
                takes a step forward. As his heel hits the ground, the frame freezes and goes to
                black and white. Shock waves in white move out from his heel where it has struck the
                floor of the arena. Cut to an overhead shot of The Boulder showing the shock wave
                emanating away from his heel in concentric circles. Cut again to the Bandit standing
                perfectly still. The shock waves reach her and travel up her body.</description>
      <description>Return to a frontal shot of the Bandit in full color. She moves forward,
                opening her arms as soon as she registers the shock wave indicating the movement of
                her opponent. Cut to a shot of her feet as she moves forward to finish the set up
                for her attack. The Boulder moves forward at a slow frame rate. He is bellowing a
                slurred battle cry. Cut to a wider shot of The Boulder as his foot strikes the
                ground again, the screen flashes black and white again as another shock wave is
                shown moving out from him. Cut back to a frontal shot of the Bandit who has begun to
                swing her right foot in an arc toward the ground in font of her. As she strikes the
                ground, the view cuts to a wide shot from behind and above on her right. The frame
                rate speeds up to normal. Her strike creates a shock wave in the arena floor that
                churns up the ground in the direction of the Boulder in a straight
                line.</description>
      <description>A quick shot of Aang staring incredulously at the camera, his face turning
                to follow the Bandit's shock wave. Cut back to a frontal shot of The Boulder whose
                foot meets the shock wave just as he puts it back on the ground. The shock wave
                makes him drop down onto the ground in a perfect split. Cut briefly to Momo and
                Sokka. Momo squeaks and Sokka's look of adulation and excitement turns to a look of
                pain. Cut to a close shot from above The Boulder. He looks up into the camera with a
                look of excruciating pain on his face.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Cut back to the Bandit who makes a chopping motion with her right hand.
                Three stalagmites erupt from the ground near The Boulder and eject him from the
                ring. He slams into the wall beneath the stands and slides down into the crevice
                between the arena and the stands.</description>
      <description>Shift to a close-up of the Bandit's face, which softens into a crafty and
                satisfied smile as Xin Fu speaks.</description>

                hand.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Xin Fu looks disappointed for a moment before the camera cuts to Aang
                entering the ring. The crowd murmurs its approval. Shift to a long, wide shot of
                Aang as he closes the distance between himself and the Bandit. Xin Fu jumps out of
                the screen. Cut to Sokka and Katara.</description>

      <description>Cut to Aang's feet; he takes a step. Cut back to the Bandit, who smiles as
                soon as his foot hits the ground. She stomps the ground with the side of her left
                foot. A shock wave travels across the ground and causes a large rock to grow out of
                the ground underneath Aang, who is launched into the air. He lands softly on the
                ground behind her. She turns around with an upset expression on her
                face.</description>

                knocks Toph out of the ring. Quick shots of Xin Fu, The Boulder who is recovering
                from his match with the Blind Bandit, and the Water Tribe siblings as they confirm
                their collective shock. Cut back to Aang, who looks around in surprise as the crowd
                cheers. Cut to a shot of the Bandit walking away from the base of the arena. In the
                background is a set of stairs. Aang is at the top of the stairs and he calls after
                the former champion.</description>

                holding the belt and the bag of gold, the crowd cheering behind them. Katara and
                Sokka enter the frame from the right. Sokka hugs Xin Fu and takes the money and the
                belt. He puts his arm around Aang's shoulder, but the Avatar is still
                morose.</description>

                land in some rose bushes, but Sokka slams painfully onto the solid ground. Aang

                that belong to someone in a brown or gold robe. The fingers have two gold rings on
                them. The camera follows the teapot as it is lifted up and opened. Lao and Poppy sit

                before he realizes the Gecko heading to him and he crashes into him. The Gopher

                calls his attention to the battle already going on. The Boulder and The Hippo
                prepare to attack Toph. Lao looks on the fight biting his nails. Headhunter flies in
                from behind to complete the ambush. However, Toph hears him and turns the center of
                the ring around to put Headhunter on a collision course with the other two
                wrestlers. With the three men down, Toph ejects them all onto the other defeated

                Xin Fu fires several rocks at her. She brings up an earth shield, deflecting them
                all. She turns part of the shield on him. He dodges one piece, but when he hits the
                ring again, Toph picks up his vibrations in it and senses an attack. She dodges a
                rock and creates a fissure, sending him flying out of the ring between Yu and Lao.
                Sokka collapses in shock at the sight. Aang and Katara are left amazed and run

            earthbender, and I'm really, really good at it. I know I've kept my life secret from
            you, but you were keeping me secret from the whole world. You were doing it to protect
            me, but I'm twelve years old and I've never had a real friend. So, now that you see who
            I really am, I hope it doesn't change the way you feel about me.</speech>
