where the

<rym sch="a">grows</rym>

And deep in the

What was the

<l>Any why was it there?</l>
<l>And why was it lifted and taken somewhere</l>
<l>
from the far end of town where the

<l>
The old

You won't see the

out of

<l>And on special dank midnights in August,</l>
<l>he peeks</l>
<l>out of the shutters</l>

<l>He'll tell you, perhaps...</l>

On the end of a

he lets down a

and you have to toss in fifteen cents and a

<l>since they have to come down</l>
<l>
through a

<l>
"Now I'll tell you", he says, with his teeth sounding

<l>It all started way back...</l>

<l>
Way back in the days when the grass was still

and the

was still
<adj>wet</adj>
</l>
<l>
and the

</l>
<l>
and the song of the
<mUp>Swomee-Swans</mUp>
rang out in
<rym sch="a">space</rym>
...
</l>
<l>
one morning, I came to this glorious
<rym sch="a">place</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
And I first saw the
<rym sch="b">trees</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
The

Truffula
<rym sch="b">Trees</rym>

</l>
<l>
The bright-colored tufts of the

Truffula
<rym sch="c">Trees</rym>

<l>
Mile after mile in the fresh morning
<rym sch="c">breeze</rym>

</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And under the trees, I saw

.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
From the
<adj>rippulous</adj>
pond
</l>
<l>
came the
<adj>comfortable</adj>
sound
</l>
<l>
of the
<mUp>Humming-Fish</mUp>
humming
</l>
<l>while splashing around.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But those trees! Those trees!</l>
<l>
Those
<mUp>Truffula Trees</mUp>
!
</l>
<l>All my life I'd been searching</l>
<l>for trees such as these.</l>
<l>The touch of their tufts</l>
<l>was much softer than silk.</l>
<l>
And they had the
<adj>sweet</adj>
smell
</l>
<l>of fresh butterfly milk.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I felt a great leaping</l>
<l>of joy in my heart.</l>
<l>I knew just what I'd do!</l>
<l>I unloaded my cart.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
In no time at all, I had built a
<adj>small</adj>
shop.
</l>
<l>
Then I chopped down a
<mUp>Truffula Tree</mUp>
with one chop.
</l>
<l>And with great skillful skill and with great speedy speed,</l>
<l>
I took the soft tuft. And I knitted a
<mUp>Thneed</mUp>
!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The instant I'd finished, I heard a
<mUp>
<sound>ga-Zump</sound>
</mUp>
!
</l>
<l>I looked.</l>
<l>I saw something pop out of the stump</l>
<l>of the tree I'd chopped down. It was sort of a man.</l>
<l>Describe him?...That's hard. I don't know if I can.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
He was
<adj>shortish</adj>
. And
<adj>oldish</adj>
.
</l>
<l>
And
<adj>brownish</adj>
. And
<adj>mossy</adj>
.
</l>
<l>And he spoke with a voice</l>
<l>
that was
<adj>sharpish</adj>
and
<adj>bossy</adj>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"Mister!" he said with a
<adj>sawdusty</adj>
sneeze,
</l>
<l>
"I am the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
. I speak for the trees.
</l>
<l>I speak for the trees, for the trees have no tongues.</l>
<l>And I'm asking you, sir, at the top of my lungs"--</l>
<l>
he was very upset as he shouted and
<sound>puffed</sound>
--
</l>
<l>
"What's that THING you've made out of my
<mUp>Truffula tuft</mUp>
?"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"Look,
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
," I said. "There's no cause for alarm.
</l>
<l>I chopped just one tree. I am doing no harm.</l>
<l>
I'm being quite useful. This thing is a

. It's a
<obj>glove</obj>
. It's a
<obj>hat</obj>

</l>
<l>But it has other uses. Yes, far beyond that.</l>
<l>
You can use it for
<obj>carpets</obj>
. For
<obj>pillows</obj>
! For
<obj>sheets</obj>

</l>
<l>
Or
<obj>curtains</obj>

</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
said,
</l>
<l>
"Sir! You are crazy with
<rym sch="a">greed</rym>

</l>
<l>There is no one on earth</l>

</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
But the very next minute I proved he was
<rym sch="a">wrong</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
For, just at that minute, a
<char name="Lorax">chap</char>
came
<rym sch="a">along</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
and he thought that the
<mUp>Thneed</mUp>
I had knitted was
<rym sch="b">great</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
He
<adj>happily</adj>
bought it for three
<rym sch="b">ninety-eight</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
I laughed at the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
, "You poor stupid guy!
</l>
<l>You never can tell what some people will buy."</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"I repeat," cried the

,
</l>
<l>"I speak for the trees!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"I'm busy," I told him.</l>
<l>"Shut up, if you please."</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
I
<adj>rushed</adj>
'cross the room, and in no time at
<rym sch="a">all</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
built a radio-phone. I put in a quick
<rym sch="a">call</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
I called all my brothers and uncles and
<rym sch="b">aunts</rym>
</l>
<l>
and I said, "Listen here! Here's a wonderful

<l>
Get over here fast! Take the road to North

</l>
<l>
Turn left at Weehawken. Sharp right at South
<rym sch="c">Stich</rym>
."
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And, in no time at all,</l>
<l>
in the factory I
<rym sch="a">built</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
the whole
<char name="Once-ler">Once-ler</char>
Family
</l>
<l>
was working full
<rym sch="a">tilt</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
We were all knitting
<rym sch="b">
<mUp>Thneeds</mUp>
</rym>
</l>
<l>
just as busy as
<rym sch="b">bees</rym>
,
</l>
<l>to the sound of the chopping</l>
<l>
of Truffula
<rym sch="b">Trees</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then...</l>
<l>
Oh! Baby!
<rym sch="a">Oh</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
How my business did
<rym sch="a">grow</rym>
!
</l>
<l>Now, chopping one tree</l>
<l>at a time</l>
<l>
was too
<rym sch="a">slow</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
So I quickly invented my
<mUp>
Super-Axe-
<rym sch="a">Hacker</rym>
</mUp>
</l>
<l>
which whacked off four
<mUp>Truffula</mUp>
Trees at one
<rym sch="a">smacker</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
We were making
<mUp>Thneeds</mUp>
</l>
<l>
four times as fast as
<rym sch="b">before</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
And that
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
?... He didn't show up any
<rym sch="b">more</rym>

</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But the next week</l>
<l>he knocked</l>
<l>on my new office door.</l>
<l>
He snapped, "I'm the

But I'm also in charge of the

<rym sch="a">round</rym>

<l>
And my poor

are all getting the

"They loved living here. But I can't let them

</stanza>
<stanza>

I, the

<l>
I meant no harm. I most truly did

<l>
No more trees. No more
<mUp>Thneeds</mUp>
. No more work to be
<rym sch="a">done</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
So, in no time, my uncles and aunts, every
<rym sch="a">one</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
all waved me good-bye. They jumped into my
<rym sch="b">cars</rym>
</l>
<l>
and drove away under the smoke-smuggered
<rym sch="b">stars</rym>
.

<l>Now all that was left 'neath the bad-smelling sky</l>
<l>was my big empty factory...</l>
<l>
the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
...
</l>
<l>and I.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
said nothing. Just gave me a glance...
</l>
<l>
just gave me a very
<adj>sad</adj>
,
<adj>sad</adj>
backward glance...
</l>
<l>as he lifted himself by the seat of his pants.</l>
<l>
And I'll never forget the
<adj>grim</adj>
look on his face
</l>
<l>when he heisted himself and took leave of this place,</l>
<l>through a hole in the smog, without leaving a trace.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And all that the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
left here in this mess
</l>
<l>was a small pile of rocks, with one word...</l>
<l>UNLESS.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Whatever that meant, well, I just couldn't guess.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>That was long, long ago.</l>
<l>But each day since that day</l>
<l>I've sat here and worried</l>
<l>and worried away.</l>
<l>Through the years, while my buildings</l>
<l>have fallen apart,</l>
<l>I've worried about it</l>
<l>with all of my heart.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"But now," says the
<char name="Once-ler">Once-ler</char>
,
</l>
<l>"Now that you're here,</l>
<l>
the word of the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
seems perfectly clear.
</l>
<l>UNLESS someone like you</l>
<l>cares a whole awful lot,</l>
<l>nothing is going to get better.</l>
<l>It's not.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"SO...</l>
<l>
Catch!" calls the
<char name="Once-ler">Once-ler</char>
.
</l>
<l>He lets something fall.</l>
<l>
"It's a
<mUp>Truffula</mUp>
Seed.
</l>
<l>It's the last one of all!</l>
<l>
You're in charge of the last of the
<mUp>Truffula</mUp>
Seeds.
</l>
<l>
And
<mUp>Truffula Trees</mUp>
are what everyone needs.
</l>
<l>
Plant a new
<mUp>Truffula</mUp>
. Treat it with care.
</l>
<l>Give it clean water. And feed it fresh air.</l>
<l>Grow a forest. Protect it from axes that hack.</l>
<l>
Then the
<char name="Lorax">Lorax</char>
</l>
<l>and all of his friends</l>
<l>may come back."</l>
