<title>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</title>
<body>
<stanza>
<l>Every Who Down in Who-ville Liked Christmas a lot...</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
But the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
,
</l>
<l>Who lived just north of Who-ville,</l>
<l>Did NOT!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
hated Christmas! The whole Christmas
<rym sch="mixed"> season!</rym>
</l>
<l>
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the
<rym sch="mixed">reason.</rym>
</l>
<l>
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just
<rym sch="mixed"> right.</rym>
</l>
<l>
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too
<rym sch="mixed">tight.</rym>
</l>
<l>
But I think that the most likely reason of
<rym sch="mixed">all,</rym>
</l>
<l>
May have been that his heart was two sizes too
<rym sch="mixed">small.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But,</l>
<l>
Whatever the
<rym sch="mixed">reason,</rym>
</l>
<l>
His heart or his
<rym sch="mixed">shoes,</rym>
</l>
<l>
He stood there on Christmas Eve, hating the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
,
</l>
<l>
Staring down from his cave with a sour,
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
y frown,
</l>
<l>
At the warm lighted windows below in their
<rym sch="mixed">town.</rym>
</l>
<l>
For he knew every Who down in Who-ville
<rym sch="mixed">beneath,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Was busy now, hanging a mistletoe
<rym sch="mixed">wreath.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"And they're hanging their stockings!" he snarled with a
<rym sch="mixed">sneer,</rym>
</l>
<l>
"Tomorrow is Christmas! It's practically
<rym sch="mixed">here!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
Then he growled, with his
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
fingers nervously
<rym sch="mixed">drumming,</rym>
</l>
<l>
"I MUST find some way to stop Christmas from
<rym sch="mixed">coming!"</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>For,</l>
<l>Tomorrow, he knew...</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>...All the Who girls and boys,</l>
<l>Would wake bright and early. They'd rush for their toys!</l>
<l>
And then! Oh, the noise!
<rym sch="mixed">Oh, the Noise! Noise! Noise! Noise!</rym>
</l>
<l>
That's one thing he hated!
<rym sch="mixed">The NOISE! NOISE! NOISE! NOISE!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Then the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
, young and old, would sit down to a
<rym sch="mixed">feast.</rym>
</l>
<l>
And they'd feast! And they'd
<rym sch="mixed">feast!</rym>
</l>
<l>
And they'd FEAST! FEAST! FEAST!
<rym sch="mixed">FEAST!</rym>
</l>
<l>
They would feast on Who-pudding, and rare Who-roast
<rym sch="mixed">beast.</rym>
</l>
<l>
Which was something the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
couldn't stand in the
<rym sch="mixed">least!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And THEN</l>
<l>They'd do something</l>
<l>He liked least of all!</l>
<l>Every Who down in Who-ville,the tall and the small,</l>
<l>
Would stand close together, with Christmas bells
<rym sch="mixed"> ringing.</rym>
</l>
<l>
They'd stand hand-in-hand. And the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
would start
<rym sch="mixed">singing!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
They'd sing! And they'd
<rym sch="mixed">sing!</rym>
</l>
<l>
AND they'd SING! SING! SING!
<rym sch="mixed">SING!</rym>
</l>
<l>
And the more the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
thought of this Who-Christmas-
<rym sch="mixed">Sing,</rym>
</l>
<l>
The more the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
thought, "I must stop this whole
<rym sch="mixed">thing!"</rym>
</l>
<l>"Why, for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!"</l>
<l>"I MUST stop this Christmas from coming!</l>
<l>...But HOW?"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then he got an idea!</l>
<l>An awful idea!</l>
<l>
THE
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
</l>
<l>GOT A WONDERFUL, AWFUL IDEA!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"I know just what to do!" The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
laughed in his
<rym sch="mixed">throat.</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he made a quick Santy Claus hat and a
<rym sch="mixed">coat.</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he chuckled, and clucked, "What a great
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
y
<rym sch="mixed">trick!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
"With this coat and this hat, I look just like Saint
<rym sch="mixed">Nick!"</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"All I need is a reindeer..."</l>
<l>
The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
looked
<rym sch="mixed">around.</rym>
</l>
<l>
But, since reindeer are scarce, there was none to be
<rym sch="mixed">found.</rym>
</l>
<l>
Did that stop the old
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
...?
</l>
<l>
No! The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
simply
<rym sch="mixed"> said,</rym>
</l>
<l>
"If I can't find a reindeer, I'll make one
<rym sch="mixed"> instead!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
So he called his dog,
<char name="Max">Max</char>
. Then he took some red
<rym sch="mixed">thread,</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he tied a big horn on the top of his
<rym sch="mixed">head.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>THEN</l>
<l>
He loaded some
<rym sch="mixed"> bags</rym>
</l>
<l>
And some old empty
<rym sch="mixed">sacks,</rym>
</l>
<l>On a ramshackle sleigh</l>
<l>
And he hitched up old
<char name="Max">Max</char>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Then the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
said, "Giddap!"
</l>
<l>And the sleigh started down</l>
<l>
Toward the homes where the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
</l>
<l>Lay a-snooze in their town.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
All their windows were dark. Quiet snow filled the
<rym sch="mixed">air.</rym>
</l>
<l>
All the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
were all dreaming sweet dreams without
<rym sch="mixed">care.</rym>
</l>
<l>
When he came to the first little house on the
<rym sch="mixed">vsquare.</rym>
</l>
<l>
"This is stop number one," the old
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
y Claus hissed
</l>
<l>And he climbed to the roof, empty bags in his fist.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then he slid down the chimney. A rather tight pinch.</l>
<l>
But, if Santa could do it, then so could the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
.
</l>
<l>He got stuck only once, for a moment or two.</l>
<l>Then he stuck his head out of the fireplace flue.</l>
<l>Where the little Who stockings all hung in a row.</l>
<l>"These stockings," he grinned, "are the first things to go!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Then he slithered and slunk, with a smile most
<rym sch="mixed">unpleasant,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Around the whole room, and he took every
<rym sch="mixed">present!</rym>
</l>
<l>
Pop guns! And bicycles! Roller skates!
<rym sch="mixed">Drums!</rym>
</l>
<l>
Checkerboards! Tricycles! Popcorn! And
<rym sch="mixed">plums!</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he stuffed them in bags. Then the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
, very
<rym sch="mixed"> nimbly,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Stuffed all the bags, one by one, up the
<rym sch="mixed">chimbley!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then he slunk to the icebox.</l>
<l>
He took the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
' feast!
</l>
<l>He took the Who-pudding!</l>
<l>He took the roast beast!</l>
<l>
He cleaned out that icebox as quick as a
<rym sch="mixed">flash.</rym>
</l>
<l>
Why, that
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
even took their last can of
<rym sch="mixed">Who-hash!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then he stuffed all the food up the chimney with glee.</l>
<l>
"And NOW!" grinned the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
,
</l>
<l>"I will stuff up the tree!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
grabbed the tree, and he started to
<rym sch="mixed">shove,</rym>
</l>
<l>
When he heard a small sound like the coo of a
<rym sch="mixed">dove.</rym>
</l>
<l>
He turned around fast, and he saw a small
<rym sch="mixed">Who!</rym>
</l>
<l>
Little
<char name="Cindy-Lou">Cindy-Lou Who</char>
, who was not more than
<rym sch="mixed">two.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
had been caught by this tiny Who
<rym sch="mixed">daughter,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Who'd got out of bed for a cup of cold
<rym sch="mixed">water.</rym>
</l>
<l>
She stared at the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
and said, "Santy Claus, why,
</l>
<l>"Why are you taking our Christmas tree? WHY?"Cindy </l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
But, you know, that old
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
was so smart and so
<rym sch="mixed">slick,</rym>
</l>
<l>
He thought up a lie, and he thought it up
<rym sch="mixed">quick!</rym>
</l>
<l>
"Why, my sweet little tot," the fake Santy Claus
<rym sch="mixed">lied,</rym>
</l>
<l>
"There's a light on this tree that won't light on one
<rym sch="mixed">side."</rym>
</l>
<l>
"So I'm taking it home to my workshop, my
<rym sch="mixed">dear."</rym>
</l>
<l>
"I'll fix it up there. Then I'll bring it back
<rym sch="mixed">here."</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And his fib fooled the child. Then he patted her
<rym sch="mixed">head,</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he got her a drink and he sent her to
<rym sch="mixed">bed.</rym>
</l>
<l>
And when
<char name="Cindy-Lou">Cindy-Lou Who</char>
went to bed with her
<rym sch="mixed">cup,</rym>
</l>
<l>
HE went to the chimney and stuffed the tree
<rym sch="mixed">up!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then the last thing he took</l>
<l>
Was the log for their
<rym sch="mixed">fire!</rym>
</l>
<l>
Then he went up the chimney, himself, the old
<rym sch="mixed">liar.</rym>
</l>
<l>
On their walls he left nothing but hooks and some
<rym sch="mixed"> wire.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And the one speck of food</l>
<l>
That he left in the
<rym sch="mixed">house,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Was a crumb that was even too small for a
<rym sch="mixed">mouse.</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>THEN</l>
<l>He did the same thing</l>
<l>
To the other
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
' houses
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Leaving crumbs</l>
<l>Much too small</l>
<l>
For the other
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
' mouses!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>It was quarter past dawn...</l>
<l>
All the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
, still a-bed,
</l>
<l>
All the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
, still asnooze
</l>
<l>When he packed up his sled,</l>
<l>
Packed it up with their presents
<rym sch="mixed">! The ribbons! The wrappings!</rym>
</l>
<l>
The tags! And the tinsel
<rym sch="mixed">! The trimmings! The trappings!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Three thousand feet up! Up the side of Mt. Crumpit,</l>
<l>He rode with his load to the tiptop to dump it!</l>
<l>
"PoohPooh to the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
!" he was
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
ishly
<rym sch="mixed">humming.</rym>
</l>
<l>
"They're finding out now that no Christmas is
<rym sch="mixed">coming!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
"They're just waking up! I know just what they'll
<rym sch="mixed">do!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
"Their mouths will hang open a minute or
<rym sch="mixed">two</rym>
</l>
<l>
Then the
<char name="Whos">Whos</char>
down in Who-ville will all cry
<rym sch="mixed"> BooHoo!"</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"That's a noise," grinned the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
,
</l>
<l>"That I simply MUST hear!"</l>
<l>
So he paused. And the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
put his hand to his ear.
</l>
<l>
And he did hear a sound rising over the
<rym sch="mixed">snow.</rym>
</l>
<l>
It started in low. Then it started to
<rym sch="mixed">grow...</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But the sound wasn't sad!</l>
<l>Why, this sound sounded merry!</l>
<l>It couldn't be so!</l>
<l>But it WAS merry! VERY!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>He stared down at Who-ville!</l>
<l>
The
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
popped his eyes!
</l>
<l>Then he shook!</l>
<l>What he saw was a shocking surprise!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Every Who down in Who-ville, the tall and the
<rym sch="mixed">small,</rym>
</l>
<l>
Was singing! Without any presents at
<rym sch="mixed">all!</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>He HADN'T stopped Christmas from coming!</l>
<l>IT CAME!</l>
<l>Somehow or other, it came just the same!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
, with his
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
-feet ice-cold in the snow,
</l>
<l>Stood puzzling and puzzling: "How could it be so?"</l>
<l>
"It came with out ribbons! It came without
<rym sch="mixed">tags!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
"It came without packages, boxes or
<rym sch="mixed"> bags!"</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he puzzled three hours, till his puzzler was
<rym sch="mixed"> sore.</rym>
</l>
<l>
Then the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
thought of something he hadn't
<rym sch="mixed">before!</rym>
</l>
<l>
"Maybe Christmas," he thought, "doesn't come from a
<rym sch="mixed">store."</rym>
</l>
<l>
"Maybe Christmas...perhaps...means a little bit
<rym sch="mixed">more!"</rym>
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And what happened then...?</l>
<l>Well...in Who-ville they say,</l>
<l>
That the
<char name="Grinch">Grinch</char>
's small heart
</l>
<l>Grew three sizes that day!</l>
<l>
And the minute his heart didn't feel quite so
<rym sch="mixed"> tight,</rym>
</l>
<l>
He whizzed with his load through the bright morning
<rym sch="mixed">light,</rym>
</l>
<l>
And he brought back the toys! And the food for the
<rym sch="mixed">feast!</rym>
</l>
<l>And he...</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>...HE HIMSELF...!</l>
<l>
The

carved the roast beast!
