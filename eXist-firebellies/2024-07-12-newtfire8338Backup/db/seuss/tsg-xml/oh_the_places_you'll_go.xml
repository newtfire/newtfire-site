<title>Oh, the Places You'll Go!</title>
<body>
<stanza>
<l>Congratulations!</l>
<l>Today is your day.</l>
<l>You're off to Great Places!</l>
<l>You're off and away!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You have brains in your head.</l>
<l>
You have feet in your
<rym sch="choose">shoes</rym>
.
</l>
<l>You can steer yourself </l>
<l>
any direction you
<rym sch="shoes">choose</rym>
.
</l>
<l>You're on your own. And you know what you know.</l>
<l>And YOU are the guy who'll decide where to go.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
You'll look up and down streets. Look 'em over with
<rym sch="there">care</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
About some you will say, "I don't choose to go
<rym sch="care">there</rym>
."
</l>
<l>
With your head full of brains and your shoes full of
<rym sch="street">feet</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
you're too smart to go down any not-so-good
<rym sch="feet">street</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And you may not find any</l>
<l>
you'll want to go
<rym sch="town">down</rym>
.
</l>
<l>In that case, of course,</l>
<l>
you'll head straight out of
<rym sch="down">town</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
It's
<mUp>opener</mUp>
there
</l>
<l>in the wide open air.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Out there things can happen</l>
<l>
and frequently
<rym sch="you">do</rym>
</l>
<l>to people as brainy</l>
<l>
and footsy as
<rym sch="do">you</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And then things start to happen,</l>
<l>
don't worry. Don't
<rym sch="too">stew</rym>
.
</l>
<l>Just go right along.</l>
<l>
You'll start happening
<rym sch="stew">too</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>OH!</l>
<l>THE PLACES YOU'LL GO!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You'll be on your way up!</l>
<l>
You'll be seeing great
<rym sch="heights">sights</rym>
!
</l>
<l>You'll join the high fliers</l>
<l>
who soar to high
<rym sch="sights">heights</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
You won't lag behind, because you'll have the
<rym sch="lead">speed</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
You'll pass the whole gang and you'll soon take the
<rym sch="speed">lead</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Wherever you fly, you'll be best of the
<rym sch="rest">best</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Wherever you go, you will top all the
<rym sch="best">rest</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Except when you
<rym sch="won't">don't</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Because, sometimes, you
<rym sch="don't">won't</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I'm sorry to say so</l>
<l>
but, sadly, it's
<rym sch="you">true</rym>
</l>
<l>that Bang-ups</l>
<l>and Hang-ups</l>
<l>
can happen to
<rym sch="true">you</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You can get all hung up</l>
<l>
in a prickle-ly
<rym sch="lurch">perch</rym>
.
</l>
<l>And your gang will fly on.</l>
<l>
You'll be left in a
<rym sch="perch">Lurch</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You'll come down from the Lurch</l>
<l>
with an unpleasant
<rym sch="slump">bump</rym>
.
</l>
<l>And the chances are, then,</l>
<l>
that you'll be in a
<rym sch="bump">Slump</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And when you're in a Slump,</l>
<l>
you're not in for much
<rym sch="done">fun</rym>
.
</l>
<l>Un-slumping yourself</l>
<l>
is not easily
<rym sch="fun">done</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
You will come to a place where the streets are not
<rym sch="darked">marked</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Some windows are lighted. But mostly they're
<rym sch="marked">
<mUp>darked</mUp>
</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
A place you could sprain both your elbow and
<rym sch="in">chin</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
Do you dare to stay out? Do you dare to go
<rym sch="chin, win">in</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
How much can you lose? How much can you
<rym sch="in">win</rym>
?
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And IF you go in, should you turn left or
<rym sch="quite">right</rym>
...
</l>
<l>
or right-and-three-quarters? Or, maybe, not
<rym sch="right">quite</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
Or go around back and sneak in from
<rym sch="find">behind</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
Simple it's not, I'm afraid you will
<rym sch="behind, mind">find</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
for a mind-maker-upper to make up his
<rym sch="find">mind</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You can get so confused</l>
<l>
that you'll start in to
<rym sch="pace">race</rym>
</l>
<l>
down long wiggled roads at a break-necking
<rym sch="race, space">pace</rym>
</l>
<l>
and grind on for miles cross weirdish wild
<rym sch="pace, place">space</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
headed, I fear, toward a most useless
<rym sch="space">place</rym>
.
</l>
<l>The Waiting Place...</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>...for people just waiting.</l>
<l>
Waiting for a
<rym sch="plain">train</rym>
to go
</l>
<l>
or a bus to come, or a
<rym sch="train">plane</rym>
to go
</l>
<l>or the mail to come, or the rain to go</l>
<l>
or the phone to ring, or the snow to
<rym sch="no">snow</rym>
</l>
<l>
or the waiting around for a Yes or
<rym sch="snow">No</rym>
</l>
<l>
or waiting for their hair to
<rym sch="snow">grow</rym>
.
</l>
<l>Everyone is just waiting.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Waiting for the fish to
<rym sch="kite">bite</rym>
</l>
<l>
or waiting for the wind to fly a
<rym sch="bite, night">kite</rym>
</l>
<l>
or waiting around for Friday
<rym sch="kite">night</rym>
</l>
<l>or waiting, perhaps, for their Uncle Jake</l>
<l>or a pot to boil, or a Better Break</l>
<l>
or a string of
<rym sch="curls">pearls</rym>
, or a pair of pants
</l>
<l>
or a wig with
<rym sch="pearls">curls</rym>
, or Another Chance.
</l>
<l>Everyone is just waiting.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>NO!</l>
<l>That's not for you!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Somehow you'll escape</l>
<l>
all that waiting and
<rym sch="playing">staying</rym>
</l>
<l>You'll find the bright places</l>
<l>
where Boom Bands are
<rym sch="staying">playing</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>With banner flip-flapping,</l>
<l>
once more you'll ride
<rym sch="sky">high</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
Ready for anything under the
<rym sch="high, guy">sky</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Ready because you're that kind of a
<rym sch="sky">guy</rym>
!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Oh, the places you'll go! There is fun to be
<rym sch="won">done</rym>
!
</l>
<l>
There are points to be scored. There are games to be
<rym sch="done">won</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
And the magical things you can do with that
<rym sch="all">ball</rym>
</l>
<l>
will make you the winning-est winner of
<rym sch="ball">all</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Fame! You'll be as famous as famous can
<rym sch="TV">be</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
with the whole wide world watching you win on
<rym sch="be">TV</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Except when they
<rym sch="won't">don't</rym>
</l>
<l>
Because, sometimes they
<rym sch="don't">won't</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I'm afraid that some times</l>
<l>
you'll play lonely games
<rym sch="you">too</rym>
.
</l>
<l>Games you can't win</l>
<l>
'cause you'll play against
<rym sch="too">you</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>All Alone!</l>
<l>
Whether you like it or
<rym sch="lot">not</rym>
,
</l>
<l>Alone will be something</l>
<l>
you'll be quite a
<rym sch="not">lot</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And when you're alone, there's a very good
<rym sch="pants">chance</rym>
</l>
<l>
you'll meet things that scare you right out of your
<rym sch="chance">pants</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
There are some, down the road between hither and
<rym sch="on">
<mUp>yon</mUp>
</rym>
,
</l>
<l>
that can scare you so much you won't want to go
<rym sch="yon">on</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But on you will go</l>
<l>
though the weather be
<rym sch="prowl">foul</rym>
.
</l>
<l>On you will go</l>
<l>
though your enemies
<rym sch="foul, howl">prowl</rym>
.
</l>
<l>On you will go</l>
<l>
though the Hakken-Kraks
<rym sch="prowl">howl</rym>
.
</l>
<l>Onward up many</l>
<l>
a frightening
<rym sch="leak">creek</rym>
,
</l>
<l>though your arms may get sore</l>
<l>
and your sneakers may
<rym sch="creek">leak</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>On and on you will hike,</l>
<l>
And I know you'll hike
<rym sch="are">far</rym>
</l>
<l>and face up to your problems</l>
<l>
whatever they
<rym sch="far">are</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>You'll get mixed up, of course,</l>
<l>
as you already
<rym sch="go">know</rym>
.
</l>
<l>You'll get mixed up </l>
<l>
with many strange birds as you
<rym sch="know">go</rym>
.
</l>
<l>So be sure when you step.</l>
<l>
Step with care and great
<rym sch="act">tact</rym>
</l>
<l>and remember that Life's </l>
<l>
a Great Balancing
<rym sch="tact">Act</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
Just never foget to be dexterous and
<rym sch="left">deft</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
And never mix up your right footb with your
<rym sch="deft">left</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And will you
<rym sch="indeed">succeed</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
Yes! You will,
<rym sch="succeed, guaranteed">indeed</rym>
!
