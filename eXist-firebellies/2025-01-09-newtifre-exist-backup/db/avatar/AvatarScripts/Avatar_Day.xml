      <description>The episode begins by showing a coast before panning down to in the middle
                of a forest where the gang is asleep, except for Momo. Switch to a view from inside
                Sokka's open mouth, looking out. A spider has set up its web over his mouth. Momo
                discovers the spider and inspects it with great interest. When a flies lands on the
                web, Momo tries to grab it. As he plunges his hand completely in Sokka's mouth,
                Sokka opens his eyes immediately in surprise. He shoots up and starts to spit out
                the remains of the spider and its web.</description>

         <charAction>Angrily.</charAction> What are you doing in my mouth? <charAction>Momo
                chitters happily while lying upside down on Sokka's belly, chewing on the fly he
                "rescued" from the spider's web.</charAction> Momo, you need to be a little more
            sensitive to my boundaries.</speech>

      <description>The lemur seems to notice something else on his left. He completely ignores
                Sokka's comment and climbs on his face, where he erects himself and pricks up his
                ears to determine what it is he heard. He chitters loudly, waking up Katara, who was
                sleeping on a nearby sawed off tree trunk.</description>
      <description>Switch to Aang, who is still sleeping soundly on Appa's forearm. He wakes
                up as the ground begins to shake. Kahchi, sitting atop a rhino, jumps out of the
                thicket. Katara gasps as two more emerge from the bushes on the other side of the
                camp.</description>

      <description>An overview shot of the campsite shows that four rhinos are circling around
                the gang.</description>
      <description>Close-up of Vachir, as he fires two flaming arrows toward Sokka, who was
                trying to crawl away like a caterpillar in his sleeping bag. The arrows pin the back
                of the sleeping bag to the ground while Sokka crawls out. He moves out of the path
                of a third arrow just in time.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">

      <description>Sokka climbs aboard Appa, where Aang's already waiting for him. Switch to a
                closer shot of Katara, as she also makes her way toward Appa. Just before she
                reaches him, she stops in her tracks and turns around.</description>
      <description>Kahchi spins his Guan Dao around and plants it in the sawed of tree trunk
                Katara was sleeping on a bit earlier. Next to the tree trunk lie some of Team
                Avatar's supplies.</description>

      <description>He jumps off Appa's head, while Sokka just manages to get on.</description>
      <description>Switch to the Guan Dao blade into the stump, right next to a wooden box.
                The camera pans to the right to reveal Katara charging Kahchi with a water whip. She
                freezes the blade solid to the trunk, giving her the opportunity to grab the box of
                scrolls. She heads back toward Appa just as Kahchi manages to break his weapon free
                of the ice.</description>
      <description>Cut to Ogodei, who is swinging his chains around. He throws them around a
                tree and pulls it down to impede Aang's progress toward his staff. It has no effect,
                as Aang just somersaults over the fallen tree.</description>
      <description>Close-up of Yeh-Lu, as he ignites one of the hand grenades hanging on his
                belt. He throws it at Aang, who has reached his staff by now. The explosive lands
                right beside him, but the fuse is still burning. Aang swirls his staff around and
                knocks the explosive out of the way and into the woods. Aang propels himself into
                the air with airbending while the bomb explodes. He lands on Appa's
                head.</description>

      <description>Appa rises from the ground, leaving the Rough Rhinos behind. Mongke shoots
                a fire ball at them as they fly over. Katara and Sokka quickly duck and cover their
                heads, as the fire ball just misses them. As Sokka erects again, he notices
                something on the ground.</description>

      <description>The camera zooms out on Sokka's boomerang, which still lies in the middle

      <description>Cut to a shot of Mongke, who angrily turns his head as Appa disappears at
                the horizon.</description>
      <description>Screen changes to a small village at the edge of a cliff, surrounded by
                open, green fields. Appa landed nearby a small, wooden house.</description>

      <description>He slowly saunters over to the stall, where Katara gives him a loving hug
                in order to comfort him before she holding her hands in front of herself while

   <section>
      <description>Aang and Katara follow Sokka with looks of sympathy as he walks away. The

      <description>They all look at each other for a moment, trying to figure out what to do.
                Aang and Katara smile at each other, while tears still run over Sokka's
                face.</description>
      <description>The camera pans down to reveal an overview shot of Chin Village. Switch to
                a shot of several festive, green lanterns hanging over the street. The shot tilts
                down. Aang, Katara, and Sokka are standing in the middle of the busy street, looking
                around in interest.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The villagers continue chanting while the runner sets fire to the Roku
                effigy next. The camera zooms in on Aang, Katara, and Sokka, who are utterly shocked
                by the turn of events. Sokka's mouth falls open and food drips out.</description>
      <description>Cut to a shot of another town atop a hill. As two people are walking down
                the quiet street, a shadowy figure quickly passes them by on the roof. The Blue
                Spirit lands in front of the two people and unsheathes his dual dao swords as he
                jumps at the man carrying two baskets, suspended on a long pole. He swiftly cuts the
                baskets off in one fluid motion. The terrified man cowers back, as the Blue Spirit
                moves in to collect his prize. He hangs the baskets over his shoulders and heads for
                the woman, who is carrying a large piece of fruit on her head. The Blue Spirit
                snatches the fruit off her head and disappears as swiftly as he had come. The man
                and woman are left in confusion as to what just happened.</description>
      <description>Switch to a scene in the forest. The camera follows the descent of a fly
                that is snatched out of the air by a chameleon resting on a branch. The Blue Spirit
                is making his way through the thicket. The mask of the Blue Spirit is placed in a
                hollow part at the base of a tree. Zuko peeks around the trunk. The camera zooms
                toward a cavern where Iroh is sitting. He looks up when Zuko drops the barrels of
                food at his feet.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Switch back to the burning effigies of the Avatars in Chin Village as the
                chants continue. The mayor signals to the torch-bearer, who is now on the roof, to
                throw his torch. The torch-bearer grins as he takes aim and throws his torch with a
                grunt right into the right eye of Aang's float. The crowd cheers in approval, while
                Aang looks at his own effigy burn with a look of pain on his face, closing his own
                right eye. Katara runs to the front and uses her waterbending to extinguish the
                flames with water from two large pots nearby.</description>

      <description>Close-up of Aang's face. His confident look quickly disappears as the
                camera cuts to the next shot, where he is cuffed with his hands and head stuck in a

                the wagon, where a wealthy man in playing with his chest full of gold pieces. He is
                thrown to the front when the cart suddenly stops. The man looks around in fear,
                quickly closing and locking the chest with the precious metal. His scared eyes shift
                from side to side to as he hears rumbling noises outside. He clutches the chest
                protectively. The cold sweat is dripping down his face. He sighs in relieve as the
                noise died down, but he swiftly cowers back in fear as two swords pierce the top of
                the cart. A fist comes crashing down through the ceiling. When the aghast man looks
                up, he sees that it were the blades of the Blue Spirit that wrecked his cart. He
                anxiously holds up his treasury toward the Blue Spirit, while trying to stay away
                from him as far as possible. The Blue Spirit snatches it out of his hands and
                disappears, leaving the surprised man. The camera moves back to reveal the shocked
                man in his chart and the unconscious soldier on the ground.</description>

                catches his attention. He looks through his magnifying monocle in order to take a
                better look at the right foot of the statue. His eyes widen as he makes a discovery.
                He swiftly runs over to the shrine that is facing the statue and examines the stone

                charges Aang, letting out a load growl. He is stopped in his tracks by the chains
                around his neck. Aang slides down the wall in fear, while the man addresses him

                slides over it. The man looks up. Two laughing, little children pass him on their
                way to great Appa and his riders. Appa lands right in front of the large, wooden
                statue of Kyoshi which is completely rebuilt. When Appa touches the ground, everyone
                in the village has gathered around to great them. They are all clapping as The
                foaming mouth guy makes it to the front. He sees Appa and all he can do is squeal.
                He gestures toward Appa in wonder, before letting out a load squeal and starts to
                foam before fainting. Some of the villagers look at him while doing his thing,

                of lava dies down again, chunks of rock fall to the ground. Kyoshi spins around and

                hat and embeds itself in the saddlebag of Yeh-Lu that is filled with bombs. Sokka
                smiles and ducks for cover. Yeh-Lu notices what is going on and tosses the saddlebag
                away, but it is too late. The force of the blast smacks him and his rhino into a
                nearby wall. As Sokka covers his head to protect himself against the flying debris,
                Yeh-Lu's helmet rolls by. Another bag lands right beside Sokka, his boomerang is
                sticking out of it.</description>

      <description>Sokka notices that Vachir is aiming at him. He quickly weighs his options
                and throws his dragon-shaped pipe at the archer. The pipe slides over the burning
                arrow and extinguishes the fire. While Vachir looks surprised at his extinguished
                arrow, Katara sneaks up behind him and cuts his saddle cord with her waterbending.
                Vachir slides down, but his foot is still stuck in his saddle, so he is dragged away
                by his rhino when Katara whips it on its rear.</description>
      <description>Switch to Aang who is having a standoff with Mongke in an alley. Mongke
                uses his firebending to increase his speed as he charges Aang. Aang jumps over him
                and is forced to raise an air shield to protect himself from Mongke's fire blast. He
                loses his fans and headdress as he slides down. Aang creates an air scooter and they
                charge each other again. He avoids Mongke's fire blast by quickly riding under the
                rhino's belly and emerges behind Mongke. He directs a powerful gale at the colonel,
                but he slides to the side to evade it. They charge at each other a third time, this
                time with Aang on foot again. When Mongke fires a powerful blast that consumes the
                whole alley, Aang jumps up and propels himself right through the blast using
                airbending, feet first. He crashes right into Mongke, sending him flying through a
                wooden fence.</description>

      <description>Uncertainly, she chews it down. She looks down at her bowl, confused of
                what to make of it. The camera pans to the right to show how Aang also sticks a
                cookie in his mouth, although half of it is still dangling out of his
                mouth.</description>
