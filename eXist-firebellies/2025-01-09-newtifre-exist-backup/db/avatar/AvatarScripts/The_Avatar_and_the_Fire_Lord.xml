      <speech speaker="Roku">Aang, it's time you learn of my history with Fire Lord Sozin. <charAction>Cut to a
                close-up of Aang's face in his dream, before cutting back to Roku.</charAction> You
            need to understand how the war began, if you want to know how to end it. <charAction>Cut
                to an overhead shot of Roku's island.</charAction> Meet me on my home island on the

      <description>Scene changes to Zuko, who is asleep as well, as sounds of footsteps wake
                him up, and he rushes to the hall to investigate. He opens the door, and sees a
                cloaked individual walk down the hall and disappear. Zuko begins to go after the
                individual, but notices a scroll lying on the floor. A surprised Zuko picks up the
                scroll and reads it.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Reading the scroll.</charAction> You need to know the story of your
            great-grandfather's demise. It will reveal your own destiny. <charAction>He closes the
                scroll, and stares down the hallway.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Shot cuts to a view from the opposite end of the hallway. Zuko is still
                standing outside his bedroom. Scene changes to a blue, cloud filled sky. A very
                large cloud moves quickly forward. Cut to the inside of the cloud, as Aang, standing
                on Appa's, bends the elements around the bison to create a cloud, to camouflage.
                Katara and Sokka look over Appa's saddle for a better look.</description>

      <description>The scene changes to an overhead of Hari Bulkan. Cut to a hall, full of
                paintings of previous Fire Lords. Zuko stands before one of the portraits, as Azula
                passes by Zuko.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">It's never too early for a sitting with the court painter, Zuko. Make sure he gets
            your good side.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">Wait, I need to ask you something. <charAction>Azula stops walking.</charAction>
            What do you remember about our great-grandfather's history?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">
         <charAction>She sighs.</charAction> Oh, Zuko, it's so strange how your mind works.
                <charAction>Cut to an overhead shot of the hall, as Azula tells Zuko about Sozin's
                history.</charAction> Fire Lord Sozin began the war, of course. <charAction>Cut to
                Fire Lord Sozin's portrait, as it pans from the bottom to the top.</charAction> He
            spent his early years secretly preparing for it. He was as patient as he was clever. He
            famously waited for the comet, later renamed Sozin's Comet, and used its power to launch
            his full-scale invasion of the world. <charAction>Cut back to Zuko and
                Azula.</charAction> In the end, he died a very old and successful man.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">But how did he die?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Azula">
         <charAction>Turning toward Zuko.</charAction> Didn't you pay
                any attention in school, Zuko? He died peacefully, in his
            sleep. <charAction>Cut to a shot of the full room, as Azula walks away.</charAction> He
            was ancient.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zuko stares, frustrated. Scene changes back to Roku's island. Team Avatar
                is sitting on the tip of a hardened wave of lava. Cut to Aang from the back, who is
                facing the ocean, and is meditating. Cut to him from the front, as his arrows glow,
                and he is shown sitting on a mountain top, surrounded by clouds, in the Spirit
                World. Fang, who is carrying Roku, flies near him, as he stands up, and Roku smiles
                at Aang. The scene cuts to Zuko in his room, lying on his back on his bed. He rolls
                over on his side and stares at the scroll. He picks it up and reads it to himself
                again.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">What does it mean?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Annoyed, he tosses the scroll aside, as it lands on a lantern. The light
                from the lantern shines through the parchment, and it reveals a secret message on
                the scroll. Zuko gasps and grabs the scroll from atop the lantern, and reads the
                secret message aloud.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Reading.</charAction> The Fire Sages keep the secret history in the
            Dragonbone Catacombs.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a close-up of Zuko's eyes, as he finishes reading the secret
                message. Zuko quickly turns to leave. Cut to a dark temple. A Fire Sage walks
                through a courtyard, and stops over a large medallion fashioned in the shape of a
                flower in the middle of the courtyard. He crouches low, and delivers a blast of fire
                into the center of the medallion. It begins to open a hidden passage, under the
                courtyard of the temple. The Sage goes into the passage through the steps. Zuko
                hides and waits behind a pillar. When no one is around, Zuko goes to the secret
                passage, and bends a blast of fire into the medallion. The passage opens, and a
                spiral staircase is revealed along with a very large secret chamber. Zuko travels
                through the chamber and down a hall lined with bones of dragons, all lined up along
                the walls of the hall. He comes to an ornate door with a metal sculpture of Fire
                Lord Sozin on it. The chest of the sculpture has a Fire Nation emblem. Zuko places
                his left hand over the emblem, and bends a fire blast. The fire fills the door, and
                comes out from the statue's eyes, nose and mouth. Zuko enters the room, pulls his
                cloak from his head, and raises his lantern to look around the dark chamber, and
                sees that the room is filled with artifacts and various vessels. A large statue of a
                dragon sits in the middle of the room. Under the dragon's head, Zuko finds Fire Lord
                Sozin's history.</description>

      <description>Scene changes to a lush Fire Nation courtyard in a flashback. Two young
                firebenders are dueling. The young men, Prince Sozin and Roku, exchange fire
                blasts.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sozin">I remember my friend.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>While they duel, Sozin notices that Roku's feet are close to a tree root.
                Sozin smiles, and using this to his advantage, he steps up his attack to drive Roku
                back, causing Roku to trip over the root and fall back. As Roku falls, Sozin grabs
                Roku by the shirt to keep him from falling. While he holds him, he raises his hand
                as if to fire blast, but instead he lets Roku fall to the ground.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>As Roku and Sozin leave the courtyard, a young Fire Nation lady goes by. As
                she walks past the friends, Roku stares at her and blushes, which Sozin
                notices.</description>

      <description>Roku walks after the young lady. He raises his hand and attempts to greet
                the lady, who also slightly blushes, but is overcome by embarrassment. He sighs,
                puts his hands on his head, and falls down. Sozin sits down next to him and
                sprinkles blades of grass on Roku's face. Shot cuts to the older Roku and Aang,
                watching Roku's history.</description>

   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Roku and Prince Sozin walk down from the stairs. As they walk down the
                stairs, the camera focuses on two young women in the crowd, one of whom is the lady
                whom Roku has a crush on, Ta Min. She looks at Roku, before looking down and
                blushes. Her friend leans over her shoulder and giggles. Roku notices the lady and
                blushes, while he continues down the stairs. Distracted, Roku falls down the stairs,
                but Sozin quickly grabs Roku by the wrist. Roku composes himself and blushes again
                from embarrassment, as Sozin laughs at his friend. The crowd suddenly grows quiet,
                as a group of Fire Sages enter the courtyard. They walk toward Prince Sozin and
                Roku, as Sozin hurries down the stairs to meet them.</description>

                <charAction>The crowd whispers, as the shot cut to Roku and Sozin, both in shock.
                Cut again to a close-up of the Sages. The Sages bow to the new Avatar.</charAction>
            It is our honor to serve you, Avatar Roku.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to a close-up of Roku, standing with his jaw dropped, bewildered. The
                camera shows the crowd on the ground, all bowing. Sozin, who is still in shock
                himself, looks around at the crowd, and quickly turns to kneel before Roku. Scene
                changes to Zuko sitting in the chamber, reading Sozin's history.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Roku does not respond to his friend's question, and continues to stare

                nowhere to be seen. Sozin widens his eyes in suprise, expression becoming blank as
                he looks around. Suddenly, Roku bursts from the ground behind Sozin, revealing that
                he has burrowed into the ground with earthbending to defend from Sozin's attack.
                Before Sozin can turn back, Roku delivers a powerful air blast at the Fire Lord,
                which causes him to slam on the gates of the room. As Sozin falls down, Roku

                quickly approaching the town, destroying it completely. Roku earthbends a gigantic
                wall, and rides the wall to meet the falling earth, and stop it. As he succeeds in
                stopping it, the volcano ejects a massive wave of lava. The flow breeches the wall
                of earth, causing Roku to flee to the bottom of the summit. He cuts into the earth
                using his earthbending, creating a channel to divert the lava into the surrounding
                ocean, away from the town. Cut to an aerial shot of the island, as the channel fills

                from his mouth at the lava, which cools and hardens, as Roku lands on it. Suddenly,
                a blast of poisonous gas spouts to his right, he turns and covers his face. He turns
                to the jet, airbending it away. Suddenly lava appears on his right, which he
                airbends, and quickly another jet of gases blasts to his left, and he quickly

                out the back side of the crater, which lessens the lava flow. As the lava flows
                down, the second volcano erupts, as Roku, no longer in the Avatar State, hopelessly

                the lava by absorbing the heat, passing it through himself, and redirects out
                through his other hand. The scene pans out to show the silhouettes of the two
                friends, controlling the disaster. Cut to the townspeople in the boats, as they see
                the volcanoes erupting. Cut to a shot of Ta Min, with an anxious expression on her
                face. The scene cuts back to Roku and Sozin on the edge of the crater. Lightning
                blasts above Sozin, as the earth beneath him becomes unstable. He begins to fall
                back off the side of the volcano, but Roku quickly earthbends an earth shelf to
                catch Sozin. Stable again, Sozin looks to Roku for a moment. Suddenly, the earth
                violently shakes and another surge of ash and rock shoot from the crater, and the
                two turn to run.</description>

   <section>
      <description>As the two run, a jet of toxic gas shoots up directly next to Sozin. Roku
                quickly airbends it away to protect Sozin. Suddenly gas erupts directly into Roku's
                face, causing him to be disoriented.</description>

      <description>Overwhelmed by the poisons, Roku falls to his knees. He looks up toward

      <description>Sozin's dragon appears. As Roku kneels, Sozin mounts the dragon and flies
                away. Cut to Roku, on the side of the volcano. He is surrounded by toxic gas, and
                behind him a surge of rock and ash flows swiftly toward him. Cut to a shot of the
                black clouds billowing from the island, as Sozin's dragon emerges from the plumes.
                The camera zooms to an extreme close-up of Sozin's eye. Shot cuts to Roku, from the
                back, still on his knees. He is coughing, and is unable to get to his feet. Fang
                appears from the right, and flies above him. Cut to a close-up of Roku from the
                side, as he looks up toward his dragon. Cut to an aerial view of the debris, rapidly
                approaching Avatar Roku. With the rock avalanche just moments away from swallowing
                Roku, Fang flies down, and wraps himself around Roku. The wave of ash and rubble
                cover the two completely, killing both of them. Fade to a bright light, as the
                camera pans to show an arched window frame. A baby's cries can be heard. The camera
                pans down to show a smiling born infant.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Who's ... wait, that's me, isn't it? <charAction>Cut to a long shot of three Air

                infant's parents, stand in the shadows.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Sozin">With Roku gone, and the great comet returning, the timing was perfect to change the

                soldiers and the Fire Navy ships.</charAction> I knew the next Avatar would be born
            an Air Nomad. So I wiped out the Air Temples. <charAction>Scene changes to a burning
                temple. The camera slowly fades into an extreme close-up of Sozin's
                face.</charAction> But somehow, the new Avatar eluded me. <charAction>Scene changes
                to Fire Navy ships searching in the polar regions.</charAction> I wasted the
            remainder of my life searching in vain. <charAction>Cut to underside of the
                ship.</charAction> I know he's hiding out there somewhere. <charAction>Camera pans
                below to show the iceberg Aang was trapped in.</charAction> The Fire Nation's

      <description>Zuko puts the scroll down and stands up, as the camera pans out. Scene
                changes to the Fire Nation prison, where Iroh is imprisoned. Cut to Zuko from the
                behind, slamming the door to the cell behind him as he enters. Cut to Iroh sitting

                facing down.</charAction> Evil and good are always at war inside you, Zuko. It is
            your nature, your legacy. But, there is a bright side. <charAction>Zuko looks
                up.</charAction> What happened generations ago can be resolved now, by you. Because
            of your legacy, you alone can cleanse the sins of our family and the Fire Nation. Born

      <description>Zuko takes the headdress from Iroh's hand, and holds the artifact, as the
                shot cuts to Zuko from the behind, standing outside of Iroh's cell. Iroh stands
                quietly, looking at his nephew. Cut to a shot of the hardened lava wave the gang had
                been sitting on. Cut to a shot of Sokka, Katara, and Toph all facing Aang as the

         <charAction>Cut to Katara, Toph and Sokka from the behind, as Aang
                speaks.</charAction> Roku was just as much Fire Nation as Sozin was, right? If
            anything, their story proves anyone's capable of great good and great evil.
                <charAction>Cut to an aerial shot of the hardened lava wave.</charAction> Everyone,
            even the Fire Lord and the Fire Nation have to be treated like they're worth giving a
