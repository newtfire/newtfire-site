      <description>The episode opens to show a cliff with a small body of water, where Team
                Avatar is residing. The camera pans downward and cuts to where Sokka is relaxing
                peacefully, floating on a large leaf in the water with Momo sleeping on his stomach,
                while Katara and Aang are facing each other while practicing
                waterbending.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>With his hair covering his eyes.</charAction> You guys are going to be
            done soon, right? We have a lot of ground to cover if we're going to make it to Omashu
            today.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Rises from her hunched-over position; turns to face Sokka
                smugly.</charAction> What? Like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?
                <charAction>Smiles at him smugly.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I could be ready in two minutes. Seriously, <charAction>Pulls back the hair covering
                his eyes.</charAction> whenever.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">So you were showing me the octopus form?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Turns her attention back to Aang.</charAction> Right, let me see your
            stance.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang assumes a defensive stance. After careful consideration, Katara walks
                over to him.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Walks under his right arm.</charAction> Your arms are too far apart.
                <charAction>Positions his arms closer together.</charAction> See, if you move them
            closer together, you protect your center. You got it?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Blushing.</charAction> Oh, yea ... thanks.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Walks away and assumes a fighting stance.</charAction> Okay, let's see
            what you got.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang bends the water, creating a globule which eventually transforms into
                eight whip-like water tentacles. He carefully maneuvers them, fending off shards of
                ice that Katara repeatedly sends at him by throwing them away or dodging them. At
                length, he manipulates one of the tentacles, curling it around her leg, gripping it
                firmly and pulling on it.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Proudly.</charAction> You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The camera cuts to where Aang dances playfully, suspended in a globule of
                water shaped like an actual octopus. Suddenly, music can be heard in the distance.
                The group witnesses a strange group of nomads playing music on instruments and
                singing, approaching them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">
         <charAction>Singing.</charAction> Da, da, da. Don't fall in love with the traveling
            girl. She'll leave you broke and brokenhearted. <charAction>Cuts to shot of the team
                standing in the lake. Sokka unexpectedly falls off his leaf into the water. Cuts to
                nomads. Chong stops singing and points at the group.</charAction> Hey, river
            people!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">We're not river people.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">
         <charAction>Puzzled.</charAction> You're not? Well then what kind of people are
            you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Just ... people.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">Aren't we all, brother?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Walks over and says accusingly.</charAction> Who are you?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">I'm Chong and this is my wife, Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind
            takes us! <charAction>He suddenly strums his lute-like instrument in a crazy fashion
                much like a rock star strums crazily on their guitar.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Starts out with a somewhat puzzled tone, but changes it to an excited
                one.</charAction> You guys are nomads? That's great! I'm a nomad!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">
         <charAction>Just as excitedly.</charAction> Hey, me too!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Blankly.</charAction> I know ... you just said that.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">Oh. <charAction>Noticing Sokka.</charAction> Nice underwear ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to close shot of Sokka, who is only wearing his swimsuit; Aang and
                Katara are standing behind him. Sokka's eyes bulge at the sudden realization that he
                is wearing very little in front of complete strangers. He grabs Momo and places him
                strategically over his underwear and slides rapidly off the screen. The scene
                switches to a forest landscape, where Zuko and Iroh are now living as fugitives. The
                camera shows a close-up of Iroh's face, as he gasps and stares in awe at a red and
                white flower. Cuts to full view of him and an area behind him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">
         <charAction>Emerging from the bushes, now sporting short, black hair.</charAction> I
            didn't find anything to eat! I can't live like this! I wasn't meant to be a fugitive.
                <charAction>Raises fists in the air and yells at the sky.</charAction> This is
            impossible! <charAction>Looking over at Iroh.</charAction> Uncle, what are you
            doing?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Cuts to Iroh who dotes over the flower. Zuko appears behind
                him.</charAction> You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a
            tea so delicious, it's heartbreaking. That, or it's the white jade, which is
            poisonous.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing. <charAction>Walks
            away.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Dreamily.</charAction> Hmm ... delectable tea? <charAction>More
                suspiciously.</charAction> Or deadly poison?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene switches to where Team Avatar and the band of nomads are lounging
                nearby Appa, whose fur is braided. Chong is casually strumming his lute. Sokka
                approaches.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Wearing a wreath of pink flowers on his head.</charAction> Hey, Sokka,
            you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere!</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">
         <charAction>Stops playing.</charAction> Well not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But
            where we haven't been, we've heard about through stories and songs.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Moku">
         <charAction>Lying on the ground; in a dreamy voice.</charAction> On the way, there's
            a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy, I guess it's up
            to me.</speech>

            rainbows.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">Wow, sounds like someone has a case of destination fever. You're worried too much
            about where you're going.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Lily">You got to focus less on the "where" and more on the "going". <charAction>She makes
                gestures with her hand, accidentally tugging on Katara's
            braid.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Chong">Sounds like you're headed to Omashu.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">There's an old story about a secret pass right through the mountains.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">Is this real or a legend?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself. <charAction>Begins
                strumming his lute and singing.</charAction> Two lovers, forbidden from one another,
            the war divides their people and the mountain divides them apart! Built a path to be
            together! <charAction>Stops playing.</charAction> Yeah, I forget the next couple of
            lines, but then it goes ... <charAction>Resumes singing.</charAction> Secret tunnel!
            Secret tunnel! Through the mountains, secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel!

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Unamused while folding his arms.</charAction> I think we'll just stick

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Yeah, thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground. <charAction>Flashing a

      <description>The scene changes to a mountainous cliffside where Fire Nation soldiers are

      <description>The scene switches to the forest, where Zuko has arrived from his fishing
                expedition. When the camera pans upward, it is revealed that he has only managed to
                spear a single, tiny fish which flaps about helplessly on the large branch he used
                for a fishing pole. Cuts to Iroh hunched over, his back to the camera.</description>

      <speech speaker="Iroh">
         <charAction>Surprisingly calmly.</charAction> When the rash spreads to my throat, I

                <charAction>Iroh holds out his arm to reveal berries.</charAction> These are bacui
            berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade.
                <charAction>Unenthusiastically.</charAction> That, or maka'ole berries that cause

      <speech speaker="Chong">That is correct, Master Arrowhead.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>Aang turns to stare at Katara, who has her back to him. Her clothes and
                hair sway slightly as a breeze passes by. The camera closes up to his face, his eyes
                shining in adoration.</description>

   <section>
      <description>They all begin to enter the cave. Cuts to a close-up of Appa as he groans.
                Several Fire Nation tanks rumble across the terrain toward the entrance of the
                tunnel and pause once they reach the mouth of the cave.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Commander">Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The
            mountain will take care of the rest.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The tanks fire rotating grappling hooks from canisters into the tunnel and
                release them after a few moments, unleashing a myriad of boulders. The scene
                switches to where the group has begun navigating their way through the tunnels only
                to turn and witness the entrance being closed off. Appa begins to frantically paw
                the walls of the tunnel.</description>

      <description>Katara and Aang look at each other with unsure expressions. The scene
                changes to a village. Camera cuts to a hospital before switching to the inside of
                the building. One doctor is treating a man with what appears to be a cupping
                treatment. The man grits his teeth in pain. The camera pans over to where a girl is
                treating Iroh's allergic reaction. Zuko is seated on a bench.</description>

      <description>Cuts to shot of Sokka looking into the dark tunnel, his back to the camera.
                A low snarl can be heard from within the darkness of the tunnel. Momo flees from his
                shoulder. Sokka suspiciously holds the torch up to the tunnel to inspect the strange
                sound. Suddenly, a wolfbat flies from the darkness of the cave toward the camera,
                causing everyone to panic.</description>

      <description>The wolfbat takes off again. In a frenzy, Sokka swats at the creature with
                the lit torch. Several hot cinders are thrown about and land on Appa's skin. Yelping
                in pain, the bison begins running around the tunnel, releasing a discharge of rocks
                and debris. Aang quickly airbends Sokka and the band of nomads out of the way of the
                falling rocks. He races toward Katara and pushes her out of the way. The camera cuts
                to where he and Katara rise from the impact and witness the division of the tunnel.
                Meanwhile, Sokka attempts to dig his way through the barrier that divides the two
                groups.</description>

                door creaks open and to a wider shot of the room as the stone doorway loosens and
                rolls off to the side. Katara jumps into the room only to have her look of hope

      <description>He walks away, the screen darkening in his wake. The scene changes to where
                Chong and his nomads are playing love songs, the camera panning down to show the
                group walking past.</description>

      <description>Sokka slaps his forehead once more. The scene changes where we now see Zuko
                and Iroh preparing to depart from Song's house. They stand outside, dozens of
                fireflies in the air.</description>

      <description>He leaves, but stops as he comes across an ostrich horse. Quietly, he walks
                over to the animal, unfastens it from its post and leads it away. The camera cuts to
                a shot from Song's front yard. Zuko appears on screen, riding the
                animal.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zuko">They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Disappointed and reluctant, Iroh mounts the ostrich horse and the two ride
                away, leaving Song upset. She quietly closes the screen door to the house. The scene
                switches to the cave where Aang and Katara are still wandering about hopelessly,
                their torch ready to burn out at any moment.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">We're going to run out of light any second now, aren't we?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">What can we do?</speech>

   <section>
      <description>She silently walks over and grabs hold of his hand. Aang smiles up at her.
                The camera cuts to a close-up of Katara's face. The two are seen leaning into one
                another as the last of the torch light fades. Suddenly, the ceiling of the cave
                lights up revealing thousands of glowing crystals gleaming overhead. Meanwhile,
                Sokka and the band of nomads are journeying through the cave when they hear low
                growls. The camera zooms in on a dark tunnel where several wolfbats come into the
                light, racing toward them. Sokka waves his hands frantically in an attempt to scare
                them off. The creatures fly straight past him.</description>

      <description>The caves rumble. Cuts to an overhead shot of the group as a wall of rock
                crumbles. Without warning, two giant badgermoles burst through the caves, causing
                the group to panic. One badgermole closes its hands together in a prayerful manner,
                closing off a tunnel behind it with earthbending. The camera shifts right across the
                group and cuts to the other badgermole which pounds the ground with its paws and
                raises a wall of earth, blocking off the exits. Cuts to an overhead shot of the cave
                where one badgermole is seen using earthbending to create a split in the earth
                between the nomads and Sokka.</description>
      <description>Cuts to Sokka who tries to avoid the badgermole's swipes. He is blown back
                several feet and starts hastily backing away, his fingers hitting a string on the
                lute in the process, producing a musical note. Cuts to a close-up of a badgermole
                who cocks its head curiously. The creatures quiet down as he picks up the lute and
                begins playing a tune.</description>

      <description>The scene switches to Aang and Katara who are standing underneath the
                ceiling of glowing crystals, their hands linked.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">They're made of some kind of crystal. They must only light up in the dark.</speech>

   <section>
      <description>She runs toward the exit. Aang stares after her before shaking his head and
                smiling. He and Appa follow close behind. They make their way out of the cave and
                into the outdoors. Appa bounds out of the tunnel and flops onto his back, tongue
                lolling out in content.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">What about Sokka?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The two seem a bit concerned at first, but a rumbling is heard. Cuts to an
                overhead shot of the exit where at that moment, Sokka and the band of nomads emerge
                from the cave, riding atop badgermoles. Debris flies everywhere and Aang and Katara
                shield themselves from the rubble. The camera pans upward to Sokka riding atop one
                of the creatures, waving, Momo flying about.</description>

      <description>Cuts to overhead shot of the cave, the camera panning to the left. Sokka
                dismounts the badgermole and approaches Katara.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Really? We let huge, ferocious beasts lead our way.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He turns to the badgermoles and waves to them as they slowly plod their way
                into the cave again. Two walls of rock rise up where the badgermoles re-entered the
                cave. The camera pans to where Momo is seemingly communicating with Appa, telling
                him of his journey through the caves. Appa seemingly roars in response to the lemur.
                Katara is seen hugging her brother.</description>

      <description>Sokka smacks his forehead, enlarging the red spot while Chong looks at him
                in curiosity. Meanwhile, Aang confronts the other nomads.</description>

   <section>
      <description>The band of nomads begins walking away. The camera pans to where Chong is
                seen placing a necklace of flowers around Sokka's neck.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Chong">Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the
            way of the journey. <charAction>Hugs him.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Chong">Hey! Good plan! <charAction>Begins playing his lute and singing. Cuts to shot of

   <section>
      <description>While Chong is singing, Aang shoots a look at Katara, Sokka crosses his
                arms and Katara blushes. The camera pans upward and fades to a scene later in the
                day where the trio is heading up the mountainside to Omashu.</description>

      <description>The camera shifts to behind him where they soon discover that Omashu has
                been captured and placed under Fire Nation rule. Ominous music is heard as a
