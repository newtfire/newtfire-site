      <description>The episode opens with a shot of the incline leading to the Royal Caldera
                city, as the camera pans above to an aerial shot of the city. Shot cuts to the Fire
                Nation Royal Palace, before cutting to Zuko's bedroom, to show Zuko tossing and
                turning in his bed, unable to sleep. He opens his eyes and gets up, donning a cloak.
                Cut to the rim of the volcano, as he walks through a path. Cut to the Capital City
                Prison as Zuko walks toward it. Cut to an overhead shot of him stopping and looking
                above. Cut to a guard walking around a balcony, who spots him.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Zuko, without speaking a word, turns around and walks away. The guard,
                seeing Zuko leave, resumes his patrol. Scene changes to some islands at day time, as
                a mysterious cloud goes toward one of the islands at an abnormal speed. Cut to the
                cloud "descending" on one of the islands.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Aang airbends the cloud surrounding Appa as the flying bison lands. Sokka
                jumps to the ground from Appa and reconnoiters, before crossing his arms and looking
                toward Team Avatar.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Great job with the cloud camo, but next time, let's disguise ourselves as the kind
            of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut. <charAction>He reconnoiters
                again.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Cut to the Toph, Katara, and Aang standing in front of Sokka, who is
                reconnoitering. Sarcastically.</charAction> Yeah, we wouldn't want a bird to hear us
            chatting up there and turn us in.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Turning back toward the other three.</charAction> Hey, we're in enemy
            territory. <charAction>He points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins
                standing on a rock behind him.</charAction> Those are enemy birds.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>One toucan puffin jumps onto Sokka's head and screeches. Cut to the other
                three as they laugh, and walk toward the cave, with Sokka following behind.
                Suddenly, he jumps above them and comes "diving" down. He looks suspicious, as shot
                cuts to an aerial shot of him running into the cave, followed by the rest of the
                group.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Well, this is it. <charAction>Cut to Sokka standing in front of the other
                three.</charAction> This is how we'll be living until the invasion begins.
                <charAction>His head drops each time he says the word, "cave".</charAction> Hiding
            in cave after cave after cave after cave ...</speech>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Cut to Katara, standing near Aang, from behind Sokka.</charAction>
            Sokka, we don't need to become cave people. What we need is some new clothes.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Yeah, blending in is better than hiding out. <charAction>Cut to Aang and
                Katara.</charAction> If we get Fire Nation disguises,
                <charAction>Smiling.</charAction> we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in
            a cave.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Cut to Toph, who is sitting down with her legs slightly
                folded.</charAction> Plus, they have real food out there. Does anyone want to sit in
            the dirt and eat cave hoppers?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Toph punches the cave wall, causing cave hoppers to jump out, Momo grabs

      <description>Cut to a view of the hanging clothes from inside a house through doorway
                where a man sleeps. Aang and Toph run across, grabbing clothes. Sokka stands still,

      <speech speaker="Toph">Hm ... I should probably wear shoes. But then I won't be able to see as well.
                <charAction>Sits down.</charAction> Sorry, shoes! <charAction>Pulls on the shoe,
                launching the sole at Sokka's face, leaving a red mark.</charAction> Finally, a
