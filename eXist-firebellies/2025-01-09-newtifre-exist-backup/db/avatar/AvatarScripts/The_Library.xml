      <description>The episode begins with a view of the mountains. The camera pans down to
                show a back shot of Aang sitting in cross legged in a prairie on the ground looking
                over a vast open savanna landscape. The landscape is mostly barren save for small
                shoots of grass which bend in the breeze. A range of mountains can be seen in the
                distance. The ground in front of Aang is littered with holes.</description>
      <description>Cut to a shot of the group from the front of Appa, Sokka, Toph, Katara, and
                Momo standing behind Aang. The Avatar is holding a thin wooden flute in both
                hands.</description>

      <description>Shot changes to show Appa, Sokka, Toph, Katara, and Momo standing behind
                Aang, who holds a flute.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Puts her hand on the ground.</charAction> A lot, actually. There's
            hundreds of little ...</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Turns around and silences Toph.</charAction> Shh! I know you can see
            underground, but don't ruin the surprise. Just watch. <charAction>Blows a note on the
                flute. A groundhog-type creature pops out of a hole in the ground and mimics the
                note.</charAction> Yeah! <charAction>Plays another note and another groundhog mimics
                it.</charAction> I'm putting an orchestra together.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Makes hand motions while looking on with annoyance.</charAction>
            Orchestra, huh? Well, la-di-da.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Three groundhogs pop out of the ground and sing descending notes. Momo
                jumps into a hole and comes out the middle one, trying to catch the groundhogs. The
                shot shows all of the holes in the ground. Aang plays four notes and Momo tries to
                catch the groundhogs that pop up. Katara giggles as she watches the amusing sight.
                Aang plays another note as Sokka runs up to Aang and plugs the flute with his
                finger, causing nothing to play. As Aang's cheeks swell with air, the Avatar looks
                at Sokka with a sad expression.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Annoyed.</charAction> This is great and all, but don't we have more
            important things to worry about? We should be making plans.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">We did make plans. We're all picking mini-vacations.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">There's no time for vacations.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">I'm learning the elements as fast as I can. I practice hard every day with Toph and
            Katara. I've been training my arrow off!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Walks next to Aang.</charAction> Yeah, what's wrong with having a little
            fun in our down time?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Even if you do master all of the elements, then what? It's not like we have a map of
            the Fire Nation. <charAction>Gestures to the side, sarcastically.</charAction> Should we
            just head west until we reach the Fire Lord's house? <charAction>Knocking on an
                imaginary door.</charAction> Knock, knock. Hello, Fire Lord? Anybody home? I don't
            think so. We need some intelligence if we're going to win this war.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang plays a note on the flute and a groundhog pops up underneath Sokka and
                sings the note.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Giggles.</charAction> All right, we'll finish our vacations and
                <charAction>Mockingly.</charAction> then we'll look for Sokka's intelligence.
                <charAction>Aang laughs.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Opening a map and shows it to Katara.</charAction> Your turn, Katara.
            Where would you like to go on your mini-vacation?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Pointing at the map.</charAction> How about the Misty Palms Oasis? That
            sounds refreshing.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Oh, yeah, I've been there. It's a pristine natural ice spring. And I usually don't
            use the word "pristine". <charAction>Cut to the symbol on the map.</charAction> It's one
            of nature's wonders.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The close-up of the map's illustration fades to the Misty Palm Oasis, which
                has a small ice spring in the center. Cut to a shot of Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Toph
                stare at the oasis in disappointment.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Must've changed ownership since I was here. <charAction>Laughs
                sheepishly.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>They walk through the entrance and the hanging sign falls down. Fade to
                Team Avatar walking past the small ice spring. They walk into the bar and pass five
                sandbenders hanging around outside. One sandbender spits at Sokka's feet. Sokka
                looks at the man angrily. The man utters a raspy groan, slurps, and chuckles. Katara
                grabs Sokka and pulls him into the bar, which is filled with weary
                travelers.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zei">
         <charAction>To the bartender.</charAction> One mango, please.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The bartender uses two swords to slice a bowl from a large chunk of ice. He
                cuts down some mangos from the overhanging fruit and dices them up. He chops up a
                piece of fruit and pours a jug of milk into the bowl, still using the swords. He
                throws a decorative umbrella and straw into the bowl and serves it to Zei, who gives
                the bartender a coin.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">I don't see anything wrong with having one of those fruity beverages while we plan
            our strategy. <charAction>Runs up to the bartender.</charAction> Excuse me.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Zei bumps into Aang and spills his drink onto the airbender.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">No worries, I clean up easy. <charAction>Airbends the drink off of his
                clothes.</charAction>

         <charAction>Shrugs.</charAction> Thanks, I try.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">An Air Nomad, right in front of me. <charAction>Shot changes to show Katara holding
                an icy bowl.</charAction> Professor Zei, head of anthropology at Ba Sing Se
            University. <charAction>Grabs Aang's arm and points at his arrow tattoo. Camera pans to
                Aang's face.</charAction> Tell me, which of the air temples do you hail
            from?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">The Southern Temple.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">
         <charAction>Measures Aang's head with a pair of calipers and speaking
                excitedly.</charAction> Oh, splendid! Now tell me- what was the primary agricultural
            product of your people?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Nervously.</charAction> Uh, are fruit pies an agricultural
            product?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Oh, truly fascinating. That is one for the journal. <charAction>While Sokka speaks,
                Zei writes in his journal.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">So Professor, you're obviously a well-traveled guy. Do you have a more current map?
            Ours seems to be a little dated.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Certainly.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka unrolls a map on a table and examines. Toph sips her drink and props
                her legs on another chair.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">What, no Fire Nation? <charAction>Straightening his back.</charAction> Doesn't
            anybody have a good map of that place?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Examines the map while the camera pans across it.</charAction> You've
            made a lot of trips into the desert.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">All in vain, I'm afraid. I've found lost civilizations all over the Earth Kingdom,
                <charAction>Raises his fist slightly.</charAction> but I haven't managed to find the
            crown jewel: Wan Shi Tong's Library. <charAction>Cut to a shot of Toph laying down. Her
                feet are closest to the camera, showing her dirt-stained
            soles.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>In disbelief.</charAction> You spent years walking through the desert to
            find some guy's library?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">This library is more valuable than gold, little lady. It is said to contain a vast
            collection of knowledge, and knowledge is priceless.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Sarcastically.</charAction> Hmm, sounds like good times.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Oh, it is. According to legend, it was built by the great Knowledge Spirit, Wan Shi
            Tong, with the help of his "foxy" knowledge seekers.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Intrigued.</charAction> Oh, so this spirit has attractive assistants,
            huh?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Puts her hand on the side of Sokka's face to stop him from
                talking.</charAction> I think he means they look like actual foxes, Sokka.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">You're both right. <charAction>Katara and Sokka turn to him in surprise. Cut to
                Zei.</charAction> Handsome little creatures. <charAction>Takes out a drawing of the
                library and places it on the table.</charAction> Wan Shi Tong and his knowledge
            seekers collected books from all over the world, and put them on display for mankind to
            read, so that we might better ourselves.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">If this place has books from all over the world, <charAction>Aang walks over to look
                at the maps while he sips his drink.</charAction> do you think they've got info on
            the Fire Nation? A map, maybe?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">I wouldn't know. But if such a thing exists, it's in Wan Shi Tong's
            Library.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Then it's settled. Aang, I do believe it's my turn. I'd like to spend my vacation
                <charAction>Cut to a shot of Sokka as he points his finger into the air
                dramatically. The background changes to a rushing one.</charAction> at the library!
                <charAction>Sokka's voice echoes. Zoom back to a group shot, with Sokka still having
                his finger raised in the air.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Waving her hand to gain the others attention.</charAction> Uh, hey, what
            about me? When do I get to pick?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">You gotta work here a little longer before you qualify for vacation time.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">Hmph! <charAction>Slams her drink on the table and folds her arms. Cut to a shot of
                Zei.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Of course, there's the matter of finding it. I've made several trips into the Si
            Wong Desert and almost died each time. <charAction>In a depressed voice.</charAction>
            I'm afraid that desert's impossible to cross.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Professor, would you like to see our sky bison?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">A sky bison?! You actually have one?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to Appa retreating from four sandbenders, as he growls.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">
         <charAction>Runs toward the sandbenders.</charAction> Sandbenders, shoo, away from
            the bison!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The sandbenders run away and get into two sand-sailers. They drive the
                sailers by creating a small tornado of sand near the sail. Cut to a ground view of
                Appa flying across the sky. Cut to Appa's saddle and pan from Katara and Toph
                leaning against the sides to Sokka who grabs a telescope and looks over the side.
                The shot changes to Momo, Zei, and Aang on Appa's head. Zei leans over Appa's
                head.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Tell me, sky bison, are you the last of your breed? <charAction>Appa growls and Zei
                responds enthusiastically.</charAction> Delightful! I only wish I spoke his tongue.
                <charAction>Scratches Appa's head.</charAction> Oh, the stories this beast could
            tell. <charAction>Momo crawls up to Zei's side and starts chittering.</charAction>
            Shush, chatty monkey.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Examines the picture of the library.</charAction> Wow, shouldn't be too
            hard to find a place like this out here.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa flies away from the camera. Cut back to the saddle.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Groans in frustration.</charAction> Does this place even exist?</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">Some say it doesn't.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Eyes widen in surprise before narrowing.</charAction> Shouldn't you have
            mentioned that before? <charAction>Collapses on the saddle, putting her feet over the
                side.</charAction>
      </speech>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to an aerial view of Appa flying. Cut to Zei, who writes in his journal

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Pointing over the side of the saddle with excitement.</charAction> There
            it is! <charAction>Everybody on Appa looks to where Toph is pointing, but they can only
                see sand dunes. Aang, Katara, and Sokka glare at Toph in annoyance for tricking
                them. Cut back to the shot of Toph.</charAction> That's what it will sound like when
            one of you spots it. <charAction>Waves her hand in front of her face with a blank grin
                to remind them of the fact that she is blind. She quickly goes back to clutching the
                saddle.</charAction>

   <section>
      <description>Cut to Appa flying and shows a closer shot of Aang driving Appa while Momo

      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Looks through his telescope and spots a tower. Pointing.</charAction>
            Down there, what's that?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Momo wakes up. Cut to the tower and Appa flies down next to

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Holding the illustrations.</charAction> Forget it. It's obviously not

            is enormous.</speech>
   </section>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zei">I think that was one of the Knowledge Seekers. <charAction>Frontal

   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Looking at the illustration Katara is holding.</charAction> No, this is
            the library- look! <charAction>Camera pans down from the tower to the
                illustration.</charAction> It's completely buried.</speech>

      <description>Cut to a zoom out shot of the spire from far away.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zei">
         <charAction>Shouting dramatically.</charAction> The library is buried?!
                <charAction>Cut to a shot of the group standing in front of the spire. Zei runs
                forward. Depressed.</charAction> My life's ambition is now full of sand.
                <charAction>Collapses. Smiling, he lifts his head and reveals a small shovel in
                hand. Excitedly.</charAction> Well, time to start excavating. <charAction>He
                attempts to unearth the library using the tiny shovel. Cut to a close-up of the
                spire's surface as Toph places her palm against it.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Toph">
         <charAction>Cut a small part of the library which Toph puts her hand
                on.</charAction> Actually, that won't be necessary. The inside seems to be
            completely intact. <charAction>Aerial shot.</charAction> And it's huge.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">That fox thingy went in through a window. I say we climb up there and give it a

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past, then maybe it can

         <charAction>Adjusting the calendar wheel.</charAction> I don't have to. We just need

                calendar, before switching to the ceiling changing from night to day. The camera
                fades to Aang looking at the night sky to the moon traveling across the ceiling, to
                the calendar wheel, to Sokka adjusting the wheel, to the sun and moon traveling
                close to each other, to Sokka trying again.</description>

                Katara, and Momo, and the defeated spirit lying unconscious on the bridge. More
                streams of sand pour in from above. Sokka and Katara climb over Wan Shi Tong and up
                the rope. Aang glides past them. Cut to a close shot of Sokka climbing the rope. He

            I've spent too long trying to find this place. <charAction>Places his hand on his chest

      <description>Wan Shi Tong screeches and shakes the rope, making Sokka and Katara fall
