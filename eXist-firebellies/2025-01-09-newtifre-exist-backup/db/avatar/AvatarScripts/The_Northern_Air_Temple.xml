      <description>The episode begins with the gang sitting around a camp site with several
                other groups, listening to a man telling a story of 'airbenders'.</description>

         <charAction>Dramatically; out of view.</charAction> So, travelers. The next time you
            think you hear a strange, large bird talking, take a closer look. It might not be a
            giant parrot, but a flying man. A member of a secret group of air walkers, who laugh at
            gravity, and laugh at those bound to the earth by it!</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cuts to a wide shot, showing the gang and the other travelers
                surrounding a small campfire. The Storyteller, having finished his story, is going
                around collecting coins from the other travelers.</charAction> Aren't airbender
            stories the greatest? <charAction>Talking to Katara and Sokka, who are sitting next to
                him.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Storyteller">
         <charAction>Arrives in front of the gang, having already collected money from the
                rest of the audience.</charAction> Jingle, jingle! <charAction>Jingles the hat in
                front of Sokka, asking for money.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Sokka searches inside his heavy cloak, and manages to pull out a bug, a
                worm and a few crumbs.</description>

      <speech speaker="Sokka">Sorry ...</speech>

      <speech speaker="Storyteller">
         <charAction>Upset and somewhat downcast.</charAction> Aww, cheapskates!
                <charAction>Walks away as Sokka puts the bugs back in his
            pocket.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang stands up and runs after the storyteller, who is kneeling in front of
                an old man.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Happily.</charAction> Hey! Thanks for the story.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Storyteller">
         <charAction>Holds out his cap.</charAction> Tell it to the cap,
                boy.&gt;
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The Storyteller shakes his cap behind him as he kneels in front of an old
                man. The shaking causes a coin to come loose and fall from the cap. As Aang searches
                his clothes for some money, Momo picks up the coin and puts it in the cap as the
                Storyteller turns around.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Storyteller">Aww, much obliged, little bat-thing. <charAction>He pets Momo on the
                head.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Having given up trying to find a coin.</charAction> It means a lot to
            hear airbender stories. It must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met
            them.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Storyteller">
         <charAction>Confused.</charAction> What are you prattling about, child? Great
            Grandpappy saw the air walkers last week. <charAction>He indicates to the old man he was
                kneeling in front of before. The old man makes a sound in his throat akin to a
                laugh, and waves a greeting to Aang. The shot cuts to Aang, who has a shocked and
                disbelieving expression.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene changes from the campsite to a shot of clouds, and Appa flying
                above them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Sitting on Appa's neck, steering. He is talking to Katara and Sokka, who
                are riding in Appa's saddle.</charAction> Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air
            Temple. This is where they had the championships for Sky Bison polo.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother.</charAction>
            Do you think we'll really find airbenders?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>He is whittling a piece of wood. The design is
                indecipherable.</charAction> You want me to be like you, or totally honest?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Crossing her arms, obviously angry with him.</charAction> Are you saying
            I'm a liar?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>He shrugs, unconcerned with her mood.</charAction> I'm saying you're an
            optimist. Same thing, basically.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Excitedly.</charAction> Hey, guys, look at this!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The camera moves to show Appa, who is flying toward a mountain with a large
                structure on top. It looks very similar to the Southern Air Temple, with obvious
                spires reminiscent of a temple's architecture. Around them are several dark specks.
                The camera zooms in, and the specks are revealed to be people, flying around the
                temple in plane-shaped contraptions.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Amazed.</charAction> They really are airbenders!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>His face falls as he sees the 'airbenders', and after Katara's excited
                outburst, he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms.</charAction> No, they're
            not.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Exuberantly.</charAction> What do you mean "they're not"? Those guys are
            flying!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Bitterly. He is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the
                temple.</charAction> Gliding maybe, but not flying. You can tell by the way they
            move, they're not airbending. Those people have no spirit.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Suddenly, a boy sitting in an oddly shaped chair flies right above them,
                nearly hitting them, and laughing as he does so.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">I don't know, Aang.<charAction>Katara points to the boy.</charAction> That kid
            seemed pretty spirited. <charAction>Katara indicates to the boy, who is flying
                dangerously close, but still laughing.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The boy begins to fly away, shooting Aang one more look back as he does so
                while grinning. Aang grins devilishly, and opens up his glider to follow the boy. He
                leaves Katara and Sokka on Appa, and they quickly become surrounded by gliders as
                they get closer to the temple. Several gliders almost hit Appa, which causes Katara
                to knock into her brother and shout in pain as Appa moves sharply to avoid
                them.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">We better find some solid ground, before it finds us. <charAction>The siblings land
                Appa on the temple courtyard, out of the hazardous sky. Aang is still flying with
                the boy, and seems to be having fun at the surprise
            competition.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Colonists">
         <charAction>Several children are on the ground, cheering on their
                friend.</charAction> Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Teo and Aang do two loop-de-loops as they fly around the air temple. The
                two boys do a spiral downwards.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">
         <charAction>The boy doesn't seem upset at Aang, and seems happy that he isn't angry
                for nearly flying into him.</charAction> Hey there, you're pretty good!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Nonchalantly, but with a smirk.</charAction> Yeah, I know. But I can do
            more than fancy gliding.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang begins flying closer to the temple, under a bridge. Cut to a scene of
                Aang jumping off his glider and allowing it to fly forward on its own. He begins
                running along a wall, switching to an air scooter halfway, before jumping off onto
                his glider again.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">
         <charAction>He is looking amazed, before thinking of his own plan.</charAction> Wow,
            I don't think I can do that. But here's a good one.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Teo turns on a small canister that is positioned under his glider. White
                smoke begins to stream from the strange contraption, and Teo flies around in the
                sky. The camera pans to show the sight from the ground, where it is revealed that he
                has created an image of Aang's face, complete with an annoyed expression. The crowd
                below cheers.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">What do you think?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Annoyed; his face mimics the one Teo has just drawn.</charAction> It's
            great.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang lands beside Katara and Sokka. Teo lands soon after and pulls on the
                brakes. Other children take the glider off of the top of his wheel chair. Teo rolls
                up to Aang.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">Hey, you're a real airbender. You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I-I've heard
            stories about you!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Rubs his head, embarrassed.</charAction> Thanks.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Sokka ignores all formalities, instead going over to Teo's chair and
                examining the strange shape and design.</charAction> Wow! This glider chair is
            incredible!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">You think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>All four walk inside the building. They enter a room filled with pipes and
                machinery. Aang looks around worriedly. Beneath the pipes, an original mural can be
                seen, although it has been destroyed by the pipes, which are sticking into the
                walls.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">Wow! <charAction>Runs up to machines.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">Yeah, my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place. Everything's powered by hot
            air. <charAction>Shows women using an elevator like contraption.</charAction> It even
            pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while we're gliding.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Monotonously.</charAction> This place is unbelievable.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Teo">Yeah, it's great, isn't it?</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">No, just unbelievable. <charAction>Walks away.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Katara approaches Teo, who seems disappointed at Aang's
                reaction.</charAction> Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little
            shocked it's so ... different.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">So better!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara walks up to Aang, who is looking at a painted wall with pipes going
                through it.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">This is supposed to be the history of my people.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara puts her hand on his shoulder. He walks over to a fountain with an
                air bison statue on it. He looks at his reflection in the dirty green water, Aang
                looks at it squeamishly. The sky bison statue suddenly has black smoke coming out of
                it's mouth.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">Ugh!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder.</charAction> I'm sure some
            parts of the temple are still the same.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Screen pans off to show Aang, Katara, Sokka and Teo walking across a bridge
                to a large room that looks well kept. The room has no roof, although around the
                walls there are statues of monks, mostly meditating.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">It's nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isn't ruined.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Katara and Aang look at a statue of a long-bearded airbender
                meditating.</description>

      <speech speaker="Man">
         <charAction>Off-screen.</charAction> Look out!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The statue is knocked down by a wrecking ball and all four cover their
                heads. Dust is coming from the statue, so all four cough. The dust clears to show
                six men standing where the statue used to be.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Mechanist">What the doodle? Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have
            to make room for the bathhouse! <charAction>He has approached Aang and the group,
                looking more surprised than upset.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>He turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him.</charAction> Do you
            know what you did!? You just destroyed something sacred! For a stupid
            bathhouse!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Mechanist">Well, people around here are starting to stink. <charAction>Waves his hand in front
                of his face, as though trying to dissipate a bad smell.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Points at the mechanist.</charAction> This whole place stinks!
                <charAction>Using his airbending, Aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge
                of the building.</charAction>
      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to exterior shot, showing the crane falling and landing heavily against
                the side of the cliff the temple is situated on. It is covered by a cloud of dirt
                and snow as it is utterly destroyed.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way! <charAction>Walks closer to
                the mechanist.</charAction> I've seen it when the monks were here! I know what it's
            supposed to be like!</speech>

            refugees <charAction>Walks behind his son's wheelchair.</charAction> after a terrible
            flood. My infant son, <charAction>Teo looks down sadly.</charAction> Teo, was badly hurt
            and lost his mother. <charAction>Sniffles.</charAction> I needed somewhere to rebuild
            and I stumbled across this place. Couldn't believe it! Everywhere! Pictures of flying
            people! But empty, <charAction>Looks around.</charAction> nobody home. Then,
                <charAction>Does a airplane like gesture, like he's flying up to Aang.</charAction>

      <speech speaker="Mechanist">Yes! Little, light flying machines! <charAction>Waves his hands up and
                down.</charAction> They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air!
            Then everyone will be on equal ground! So to speak. We're just in the process of
            improving upon what's already here. <charAction>Katara wipes her tears on Aang's shirt,
                and Sokka looks like he's holding back tears.</charAction> And, after all, isn't
            that what nature does?</speech>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Nature knows where to stop.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Mechanist">I suppose that's true. Unfortunately, progress has a way of getting away from us.
            Look at the time! <charAction>Points at candles.</charAction> Come! <charAction>To other
                workers.</charAction> The pulley system must be oiled before dark.</speech>

      <speech speaker="Mechanist">Four flashes. So it's exactly four hours past mid-day. Or, as I call it: four
            o'candle. <charAction>Sokka laughs. Cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist, pleased that
                Sokka is interested.</charAction> If you like that, wait till you see my finger-safe
            knife sharpener. <charAction>He holds up his left hand, revealing that three of the
                fingers are made of wood.</charAction> Only took me three tries to get it right.
                <charAction>He pulls off the three wooden fingers, and throws them into Sokka's
