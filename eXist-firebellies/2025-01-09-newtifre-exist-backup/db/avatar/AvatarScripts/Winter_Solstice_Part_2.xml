      <description>The scene opens to a full moon in the sky. The camera pans down and shows
                Senlin Village during early morning hours. Cut to a view from among the houses,
                slowly zooming in on Aang who tries to get Appa to move, yanking on the reins,
                though the bison continually refuses and sits down.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Strained voice.</charAction> Let's go, Appa! Come on, boy!
                <charAction>Appa roars in protest and sits down. Cut to a close side-view; Aang
                sadly addresses his pet.</charAction> Look I'm sorry, but Katara and Sokka aren't
            coming to the Fire Nation with us. <charAction>Frontal shot; looks down and away,
                sadly.</charAction> If they got hurt, I'd never forgive myself. <charAction>Cut back
                to the side-shot; sternly, emphasizing his command by straightening
                himself.</charAction> So get your big butt off the ground and let's go!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>He jerks at the reins, stretching them out, but is flung to the ground when
                the ropes pull him back as Appa did not move a muscle. Cut to a forlorn looking
                Aang, sitting spread-legged on the ground.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Voice-over; Aang gasps in surprise and looks over his right shoulder and
                over his left, turning around in search for the origins of the voice.</charAction> I
            think his big butt is trying to tell ya something.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Cut to a frontal shot of Appa as the camera swiftly pans to the right to
                reveal a collection of Senlin villagers, with Katara and Sokka standing in the
                front.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">
         <charAction>Desperately.</charAction> Please don't go Aang. The world can't afford
            to lose you to the Fire Nation. <charAction>Closer shot of Katara's pleading
                face.</charAction> Neither can I.</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Looks away sadly and recalls an image of Sozin's Comet.</charAction> But
            I have to talk to Avatar Roku to find out what my vision means! <charAction>Side-shot as
                he approaches his friends.</charAction> I need to get to the Fire Temple before the
            sun sets on the solstice. That's today!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Aang airbends himself atop Appa's head. Close shot of him looking back with
                a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave. As Appa stands up, the shot
                changes to a frontal view, and Katara and Sokka run to stand before the bison,
                preventing him from moving any further.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Katara">We're not letting you go into the Fire Nation, Aang.</speech>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Sokka">
         <charAction>Aang stares curiously.</charAction> At least, not without your friends.
            We got your back. <charAction>Momo soars up and perches atop Aang's shoulder, and Appa
                licks Sokka, who angrily looks at the bison.</charAction> Ew!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <speech speaker="Senlin Village leader">It's a long journey to the Crescent Island. <charAction>Hands Aang a small
                bundle.</charAction> You'll have to fly fast to have any chance of making it before
            sundown. Good luck.</speech>

      <description>Appa takes off with Aang, Momo, Katara, and Sokka. Later that morning, the
                Senlin Village leader exits a building, but he stops in his track upon finding Zuko
                standing in his path. In the background, Iroh is sitting on a komodo

      <description>The sky becomes littered with flaming fireballs fired from the blockade.
                View from Zuko's ship as the fireballs fill the sky. Close-up of a screaming Aang,
                Sokka, and Katara. Zoom out as Appa evades numerous fireballs, some exploding
                mid-air. Camera switch to forward view, close-up, as they fly through a blanket of
                fireballs. The team flies directly through one that exploded before them, Appa's fur
                darkened from the explosion. Katara, Sokka, and Momo all slap out embers on Appa's
                fur.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">Appa, are you okay? <charAction>Appa roars a reply. They soar higher into the

   <section>
      <description>On the ocean surface, Zuko's ship is narrowly missing many falling
                fireballs. Sheets of ocean water crash over the ship, and crew members run for
                safety. A single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Close-up of Aang's view. Just over a cloud; fireballs burst through
                everywhere and smoke fills the screen. Aang, Katara, and Sokka scream and duck away,
                while Katara and Sokka grip Appa's saddle. Appa dodges many fireballs before two
                collide and explode in front of him. Sokka is thrown from the saddle and begins to
                plunge for the ocean, screaming anew.</description>

      <speech speaker="Aang">
         <charAction>Cries out desperately.</charAction> Sokka! <charAction>Whips the reins

      </speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>Appa reaches Sokka just in time. Katara grabs his hand, pulling him back
                into saddle. Appa skims the ocean surface. A fish appears out of nowhere and slaps
                Sokka square in the face, knocking him into the saddle. Momo leaps up and grabs the
                fish as Appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean. Fireballs crash
                into the water all around them.</description>

      <speech speaker="Zhao">Ready ... <charAction>Holds hand up, issuing his command.</charAction>

      <description>Close-up of Appa's view, approaching the ships. Camera switch once to Zhao,
                moving to prepare the signal. Back to Aang, a look of obstinate determination
                overcomes him.</description>

   <section>
      <speech speaker="Zhao">Fire!</speech>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>A single catapult launches a fire blast directly toward Appa. Close-up of
                Aang's eye as it snaps open, unafraid. Aang airbends forward off of Appa's head. He
                uses a powerful airbending kick, and the flaming boulder explodes in a large smoky
                blast. Aang falls back to Appa's head, Katara and Sokka grabbing him. Appa soars
                safely over the blockade, passing them.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Scene switch to just overhead Zuko's ship. His small vessel approaches two
                ships in the blockade. These two ships sail opposite directions, in a moment they
                will close off Zuko's ship's path.</description>

   <section>
      <description>Each ship in the blockade halts, allowing Zuko's ship to glide by beneath
                their deck, untouched. Zhao stands high, sharing an interlocked gaze with the
                banished prince below. Zuko and Iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely
                through. Iroh strokes his gray beard curiously.</description>
   </section>
   <section>
      <description>The scene cuts back to Appa, flying among blue skies. Sokka and Katara sit
                up in the saddle, while Aang sits on Appa's head.</description>
      <description>The scene changes to Sokka slumped in the back of the saddle. Katara is
                leaning her arms over the front of the saddle, and Aang is lounging against Appa's
                neck.</description>
      <description>The sky has changed to a darker, sunset-filled evening. Appa is visibly
                tired. Aang is sprawled over Appa's head with Momo equally sprawled over Aang's
                head. Katara and Sokka have each collapsed into the saddle.</description>

      <description>Appa is lying at the base of a stone bridge leading up to the island's
                mountain. The bridge ends at an elegant, multi-story Fire Temple. Lava is flowing
                beneath the bridge. The air is thick with steam. Aang stands by Appa's head, and
                Katara stands to Appa's side. Sokka is stretching further away.</description>

                <charAction>Zuko scowls sharply. Firebenders step behind him, seizing his

      <speech speaker="Roku">One hundred years ago, <charAction>Viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark
                sky.</charAction> Fire Lord Sozin used that comet to begin the War. He and his
            firebending army harnessed its incredible power, and dealt a deadly first strike against

            summer, and Fire Lord Ozai will use its power to finish the War, once and for all.
                <charAction>Visual and audio of Ozai's silhouette roaring upward, fire streaming
                from his mouth.</charAction> If he succeeds, even the Avatar won't be able to

                away.</description>

      <description>Avatar Roku draws the circling fire together in one motion. He sends it
                forward in one powerful wave that sears the room, blasting the offenders off their
                feet and melting the chains binding Katara, Sokka, Shyu, and Zuko with precision.
                View of outside the temple as the blast destroys the outer wall. Close-up of ghostly
                Avatar Roku, turning his glowing glare upon the offending sages. The sages panic,
                all turning to run from his wrath.</description>

      <description>Roku kneels into a forward strike, melting the floor with a molten
                firebending trail. He steadily lifts his hand, causing the stream of lava below to
                erupt into maddened explosions. The lava soars through the temple, tearing it apart.
                Zhao and his firebenders are shown fleeing for the temple's exit.</description>
      <description>Katara and Sokka huddle together, arm-in-arm, behind a column. Sokka kneels
                over his sister, protecting her in a brotherly fashion. The destruction ceases
                momentarily as Roku lowers his hands, exhaling soundly. The solstice' beam of
                sunlight is shown leaving his statue; its eyes no longer glow. As this happens all
                smoke in the room draws in upon Avatar Roku, his form disappearing to leave behind a
                weary Aang.</description>

      <description>Visual of the temple as it begins to lean, due to the destruction caused.
                Aang, Katara and Sokka stare in horror upon seeing the stairwell leading to the exit
                filled with lava. They quickly turn to the only exit; the hole in the wall Roku had
                created. There is no escaping, as they are on the top level of the
                temple.</description>
      <description>All three gasp in surprise as they notice Appa and Momo swiftly closing in.
                They run out of the temple, leaping into Appa's saddle. Scene of them flying away on
                Appa, gazing back at the destruction. Momo pops up wearing the Great Fire Sage's
                hat. Scene of Zhao watching the bison fly away.</description>

      <description>Night time falls. Appa flies through the clouds. Scene from behind, a
                mourning Aang with his head hung. Katara and Sokka stand and approach their friend,
