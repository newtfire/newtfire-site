<title>The Butter Battle</title>
<body>
<stanza>
<l>On the last day of summer,</l>
<l>ten hours before fall . . .</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>. . . my grandfather took me</l>
<l>out to the Wall.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>For a while he stood silent.</l>
<l>Then finally he said,</l>
<l>with a very bad shake</l>
<l>of his very old head,</l>
<l>"As you know, on this side of the Wall</l>
<l>
we are
<mUp>Yooks</mUp>
.
</l>
<l>On the far other side of this Wall</l>
<l>
live the
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
."
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Then my grandfather said,</l>
<l>"It's high time that you knew</l>
<l>
of the
<adj>terribly</adj>
<adj>horrible</adj>
thing that
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
do.
</l>
<l>
In every Zookhouse and in every
<place>Zooktown</place>
</l>
<l>
every
<mUp>Zookeats</mUp>
his bread
</l>
<l>with the butter side down!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"But we
<mUp>Yooks</mUp>
, as you know,
</l>
<l>when we breakfast or sup,</l>
<l>spread our bread," Grandpa said,</l>
<l>"with the butter side up.</l>
<l>That's the right, honest way!"</l>
<l>Grandpa gritted his teeth.</l>
<l>
"So you can't trust a
<mUp>Zookwho</mUp>
spreads bread underneath!
</l>
<l>
Every
<mUp>Zook</mUp>
must be watched!
</l>
<l>He has kinks in his soul!</l>
<l>That's why, as a youth, I made watching my goal,</l>
<l>
watching
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
for the
<mUp>Zook</mUp>
-Watching Border Patrol!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>In those days, of course,</l>
<l>the Wall wasn't so high</l>
<l>
and I could look any
<mUp>Zook</mUp>
</l>
<l>Square in the eye.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>If he dared to come close</l>
<l>I could give him a twitch</l>
<l>with my tough-tufted</l>
<l>
prickely
<mUp>Snick-Berry</mUp>
Switch.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>For a while that worked fine.</l>
<l>
All the
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
stayed away
</l>
<l>and our country was safe.</l>
<l>
Then one
<adj>terrible</adj>
day
</l>
<l>
a very rude
<mUp>Zook</mUp>
by the name of
<char n="1" type="side">VanItch</char>
</l>
<l>
snuck up and sling shotted my
<mUp>Snick-Berry</mUp>
Switch!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>With my broken-off switch, with my head hung in shame,</l>
<l>
to the
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookeroo</char>
in great sorrow I came.
</l>
<l>But our Leader just smiled. He said, "You're not to blame.</l>
<l>
And those
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
will be sorry they started this game.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"We'll dress you right up in a fancier suit!</l>
<l>We'll give you a fancier slingshot to shoot!"</l>
<l>
And he ordered the Boys in the Back Room to
<mUp>figger</mUp>
</l>
<l>
how to build me some sort of a triple-sling
<mUp>jigger</mUp>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
With my Triple-Sling
<mUp>Jigger</mUp>
</l>
<l>I sure felt much bigger.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I marched to the Wall with great vim and great vigor,</l>
<l>
right up to
<char name="VanItch">VanItch</char>
with my hand on the trigger.
</l>
<l>"I'll have no more nonsense," I said with a frown,</l>
<l>
"from
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
who eat bread with the butter side down!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
<char n="1">VanItch</char>
looked quite sickly.
</l>
<l>He ran off quite quickly.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I'm unhappy to say</l>
<l>he came back the next day</l>
<l>
in a
<adj>
<mUp>spiffy</mUp>
</adj>
new suit with a big new machine,
</l>
<l>
and he
<sound>snarled</sound>
as he said, looking
<adj>frightfully</adj>
mean,
</l>
<l>
"You may fling those hard rocks with your Triple-Sling
<mUp>Jigger</mUp>
.
</l>
<l>But I, also, now have my hand on a trigger!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
My wonderful weapon, the
<mUp>Jigger</mUp>
-Rock Snatchem,
</l>
<l>will fling 'em right back just as quick as we catch 'em.</l>
<l>We'll have no more nonsense.</l>
<l>
We'll take no more
<mUp>gupp</mUp>
</l>
<l>
from you
<mUp>Yooks</mUp>
who eat bread with the butter side up!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"I have failed, sir," I sobbed as I made my report</l>
<l>
to the
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookeroo</char>
in the headquarters fort.
</l>
<l>He just laughed. "You've done nothing at all of the sort.</l>
<l>Our slingshots have failed.</l>
<l>That was old-fashioned stuff.</l>
<l>Slingshots, dear boy,</l>
<l>are not modern enough.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"All we need is some
<mUp>newfangled</mUp>
kind of gun.
</l>
<l>
My Boys in the
<place>Back Room</place>
have already begun
</l>
<l>
to think up a
<mUp>walloping whizz-zinger</mUp>
one!
</l>
<l>My Bright Boys are thinking.</l>
<l>They're on the right track.</l>
<l>They'll think one up quick</l>
<l>and we'll send you right back!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>They thought up a great one!</l>
<l>They certainly did.</l>
<l>
They thought up a gun called the
<mUp>Kick-a-Poo</mUp>
Kid
</l>
<l>
which they loaded with powerful
<mUp>Poo-a-Doo</mUp>
Powder
</l>
<l>and ants' eggs and bees' legs</l>
<l>and dried-fried clam chowder.</l>
<l>And they carefully trained a real smart dog named Daniel</l>
<l>to serve as our country's first gun-toting spaniel.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Then Daniel, the
<mUp>Kick-a-Poo</mUp>
Spaniel, and I
</l>
<l>marched back toward the Wall</l>
<l>with our heads held up high</l>
<l>while everyone cheered and their cheers filled the sky:</l>
<l>"Fight! Fight for the Butter side UP!</l>
<l>Do or die!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>Well . . .</l>
<l>We didn't do.</l>
<l>And we didn't quite die.</l>
<l>But we sure did get worsted, poor Daniel and I.</l>
<l>VanItch was there too! And he said, the old pig,</l>
<l>"The Boys in my Back Room invented this rig</l>
<l>called the Eight-Nozzled, Elephant-Toted Boom-Blitz.</l>
<l>It shoots high-explosive sour cherry stone pits</l>
<l>and will put your dumb Kick-a-Poo Kid on the fritz!"</l>
<l>Poor Daniel and I</l>
<l>were scared out of our witz!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Once more, by
<char name="VanItch">VanItch</char>
I was bested and beat.
</l>
<l>Once again I limped home from the Wall in defeat.</l>
<l>I dragged and I sagged</l>
<l>and my spirits were low,</l>
<l>as low as I thought that they ever could go,</l>
<l>
when I heard a
<mUp>Boom-Bah</mUp>
!
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And a
<mUp>Diddle-dee-Dill</mUp>
!
</l>
<l>And our Butter-Up Band</l>
<l>marched up over the hill!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookeroo</char>
had sent them to meet me
</l>
<l>along with the Right-Sid-Up Song Girls to greet me.</l>
<l>They sang:</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"Oh, be faithful!</l>
<l>Believe in thy butter!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And they lifted my spirits right out of the gutter!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
"My boy," smiled the
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookeroo</char>
, "we've just voted
</l>
<l>and made you a general! You've been promoted.</l>
<l>Your pretty new uniform's ready. Get in it!</l>
<l>The Big War is coming. You're going to begin it!</l>
<l>And what's more, this time you are certain to win it.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"My Boys in the Back Room have finally found how.</l>
<l>Just wait till you see what they've puttered up now!</l>
<l>In their great new machine you'll fly over the Wall</l>
<l>
and clobber those Butter-Down
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
one and all!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Those Boy in the
<place>Back Room</place>
sure knew how to putter!
</l>
<l>They made me a thing called the Utterly Sputter</l>
<l>and I jumped aboard with my heart all aflutter</l>
<l>and steered toward the land"</l>
<l>of the Upside-Down Butter.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>This machine was so modern, so frightfully new,</l>
<l>no one knew quite exactly just what it would do!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>But it had several faucets that sprinkled Blue Goo</l>
<l>which, somehow, would sprinkle the Zooks as I flew</l>
<l>and gum up that upside-down butter they chew.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I was racing pell-mell</l>
<l>when I heard a voice yell,</l>
<l>
"If you sprinkle us
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
,
</l>
<l>you'll get sprinkled as well!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>VanItch had a Sputter exactly like mine!</l>
<l>
And he yelled, "My
<adj>Blue</adj>
-
<mUp>Gooer</mUp>
is working just fine!
</l>
<l>
And I'm here to say that if
<mUp>Yooks</mUp>
can goo
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
,
</l>
<l>
you'd better forget it. 'Cause
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
can goo
<mUp>Yooks</mUp>
!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I flew right back home</l>
<l>and, as you may have guessed,</l>
<l>I was downright despondent,</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>disturbed,</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>and depressed.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>And I saw, just as soon as I stepped back on land,</l>
<l>so were all of the girls of the Butter-Up Band.</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
The
<char name="Chief Drum Majorette">Chief Drum Majorette</char>
, Miz Yookie-Ann Sue,
</l>
<l>said, "That was a pretty sour flight that you flew.</l>
<l>
And the
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookerooo</char>
has been looking for you!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>I raced to his office. The place was a sight.</l>
<l>
"Have no fears," said the
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief</char>
. "Everything is all right.
</l>
<l>
My Bright
<place>Back Room</place>
Boys have been brighter than bright.
</l>
<l>They've thought up a gadget that's Newer than New.</l>
<l>
It is filled with mysterious
<mUp>Moo-Lacka-Moo</mUp>
</l>
<l>
and can blow all those
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
clear to
<mUp>Sala-ma-goo</mUp>
.
</l>
<l>THEY'VE INVENTED</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>THE BITSY</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>BIG-BOY BOOMEROO!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"You just run to the Wall like a nice little man."</l>
<l>
Drop this bomb on the
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
just as fast as you can.
</l>
<l>I have ordered all Yooks to stay safe underground"</l>
<l>while the Bitsy Big-Boy Boomeroo is around."</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>As I raced for that Wall, with the bomb in my hand,</l>
<l>I noticed that every last Yook in our land</l>
<l>
was obeying our
<char name="Chief Yookeroo">Chief Yookeroo's</char>
grim command.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>They were all bravely marching,</l>
<l>with banners aflutter,</l>
<l>down a hole! For their country!</l>
<l>And Right-Side-Up Butter!</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>That's when Grandfather found me!</l>
<l>He grabbed me. He said,</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"You should be down that hole!</l>
<l>And you're up here instead!</l>
<l>But perhaps this is all for the better, somehow.</l>
<l>You will se me make history!</l>
<l>RIGHT HERE! AND RIGHT NOW!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
Grandpa leapt up that Wall with a
<mUp>lopulous</mUp>
leap
</l>
<l>and he cleared his hoarse throat</l>
<l>
with a
<mUp>bopulous</mUp>
beep.
</l>
<l>He screamed, "Here's the end of that terrible town</l>
<l>
full of
<mUp>Zooks</mUp>
who eat bread with the butter side down!"
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>
And at that very instant we heard a
<mUp>klupp-klupp</mUp>
</l>
<l>
of feet on the Wall and old
<char name="VanItch">VanItch</char>
<mUp>klupped</mUp>
up!
</l>
<l>The Boys in HIS Back Room had made him one too!</l>
<l>In his fist was another Big-Boy Boomeroo!</l>
<l>"I'll blow you," he yelled, "into pork and wee beans!</l>
<l>I'll butter-side-up you to small smithereens!"</l>
</stanza>
<stanza>
<l>"Grandpa! I shouted. "Be careful! Oh, gee!</l>
<l>Who's going to drop it?</l>
<l>Will you . . . ? Or will he . . . ?</l>
<l>"Be patient," said Grandpa. "We'll see.</l>
<l>We will see . . . "</l>
