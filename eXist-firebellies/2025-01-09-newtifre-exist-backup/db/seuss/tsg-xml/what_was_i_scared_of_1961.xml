<title>What Was I Scared Of?</title>
<body>
<stanza rhyme="ABCB">
<l>Well...</l>
<l>I was walking in the night</l>
<l>
And I saw nothing
<rym sch="a">scary</rym>
.
</l>
<l>For I have never been afraid</l>
<l>
Of anything. Not
<rym sch="a">very</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza rhyme="ABCB">
<l>
Then I was
<adj>deep</adj>
within the woods
</l>
<l>
When, suddenly, I spied
<rym sch="b">them</rym>
.
</l>
<l>
I saw a pair of

<adj>green</adj>
<obj>pants</obj>

<l>
With nobody inside

!

<stanza rhyme="ABCB">
<l>I wasn't scared. But, yet, I stopped</l>
<l>
What could those
<obj>pants</obj>
be there
<rym sch="c">for</rym>
?
</l>
<l>
What could a pair of

at night
</l>
<l>
Be standing in the air

</stanza>
<stanza rhyme="ABCB">
<l>
And then they moved? Those
<adj>empty</adj>
<obj>pants</obj>
!
</l>
<l>
They kind of started
<rym sch="d">jumping</rym>
.
</l>
<l>And then my heart, I must admit,</l>
<l>
It kind of started
<rym sch="d">thumping</rym>
.
</l>
</stanza>
<stanza rhyme="ABCB">
<l>So I got out. I got out fast</l>
<l>
As fast as I could go,
<rym sch="e">sir</rym>

</l>
<l>I wasn't scared. But pants like that</l>
<l>
I did not care for. No,
<rym sch="e">sir</rym>

<l>After that a week went by.</l>
<l>
Then one
<adj>dark</adj>
night in

<mUp>Grin-itch</mUp>
</rym>
</l>
<l>(I had to do an errand there</l>

I was starting back through

raced around a corner

And they almost knocked me

<l>
I lost my

spinach

<l>I ran for home! Believe me,</l>

That, I'll tell you, but I hate
