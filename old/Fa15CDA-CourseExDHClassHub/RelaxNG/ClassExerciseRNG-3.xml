    <body><txt paragraph="first">I write from this doomed city and I have great doubts that this will
    reach you. We had arranged, before this horror [The General Strike], to
    stay with <name>Dadie</name> at <location>Cambridge</location> on the <time date="1926-05-21">21st</time>—God knows what will have
    happened by then. But let us come later, if its possible. We very much
    want to.</txt>
    
    <txt paragraph="second">There has been such confusion here <situation>(all helpers in the Press fled)</situation> that
    we couldn't send you <name>Viola</name> [Tree's Castles in the Air]; now parcels aren't
    taken. But we will send directly it is possible again:</txt>
    
    <txt paragraph="third">Well—I like <animal type="snakes"/>: so far as human feelings are left me. After <time>2 days</time>
    of worrying and doing nothing, and talking and listening in, one is scarcely
    a <animal type="worm"/>, let alone a<animal type="bird"/>. <question>What happens to you in the country?</question></txt></body>
