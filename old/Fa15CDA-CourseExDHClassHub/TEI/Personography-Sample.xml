              It's very typical for her era, and she was known to have only average penmanship.  There may be more to this recipe because we see "(over)" written at the bottom right of the recipe card. </handNote>

           <p>
              This is my <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName>'s <name type="recipe">cheese straw</name> recipe. <persName ref="NFSS"><forename type="first">Nancy</forename> <forename type="middle">Frances</forename> <surname>Seats</surname> <surname>Sisk</surname></persName> was born in <date type="birth" when="1928">1928</date> in 
              <placeName type="city">Lewisville, NC</placeName> to a family that owned a small farm and a <placeName type="store">Mom and Pop store</placeName> (literally: my great-
              grandparents were actually known to customers and family as <persName ref="#ES" type="nickname">Mom</persName> and <persName type="nickname">Pop</persName>). This is my 
              great grandmother <persName ref="#ES"><forename type="first">Ethel</forename> <surname>Seats</surname></persName>'s recipe modified by my grandmother (called <persName ref="#NFSS"><forename type="nickname">Frances</forename></persName> or <persName type="nickname">Fanny</persName>) for the <date from="1950" to="1979">1950s-1970s</date> taste 
              for processed food. For that era, everything from a national brand seemed better than local 
              alternatives. <name type="recipe">Cheese straws</name> are a <placeName type="city">Winston-Salem, NC</placeName> favorite. They are spicy cheese cookies, 
              bizarre but delicious. I grew up eating <name type="recipe">cheese straws</name> as party snacks, particularly around <date when="--12-25">Christmas</date>. 
              <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName> gives my dad, <persName ref="#RKT"><forename type="first">Richard</forename> <forename type="middle">K.</forename> <surname>Triplette</surname></persName> (born <date type="birth" when="1952">1952</date>) a full  <name type="brand">Tupperware</name> container of these every <date when="--12-25">Christmas</date> as his present.
                <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName> 
              graduated from a <name type="school">Winston-Salem</name> high school at a time when this was a major accomplishment, 
              especially for a woman from a rural family. Some of the girls among my <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName>'s eleven siblings graduated 
              high school, but only one of the boys, her younger brother <persName ref="#WS"><forename type="first">Worth</forename></persName>, was allowed to stay in school. He eventually
              became a high school teacher. <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName>'s other brothers worked on the farm and then joined the army, leaving school around the sixth grade. <persName ref="#NFSS" type="nickname">Nana</persName> worked as a hairstylist <date from="1950" to="2000">from the 1950's up until c. 2000</date>. She married my grandfather, <persName ref="#VS"><forename type="first">Victor</forename> <surname>Sisk</surname></persName>, who did not have a high school degree. <persName ref="#VS"><forename type="first">Victor</forename></persName> served as an army radio operator during <name type="war">WWI</name> and afterward found a job as plant manager in a typical
              a textile company, <name type="company">The Salem Company</name> (later <name type="company">Lucia</name>). My mom, <persName ref="#KST"><forename type="first">Kathy</forename> <surname>Sisk</surname> <surname>Triplette</surname></persName>, born <date type="birth" when="1951">1951</date>, is their first of two daughters.

<!-- nll 2015-09-22: I tried my best on the header section.  I feel like TEI is easier to grasp now that I know how to look certain ideas
up in the TEI master handbook!  Also, I tried my best in adding the personography to the back part of the text section, and I tried to 
fix my body section as well!  Thank you for all of the advice and the encouragment Dr. B!!-->
