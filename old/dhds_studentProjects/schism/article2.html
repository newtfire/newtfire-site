									</li>
									<li>Johnson:
									<ul>
										<li>"I don't talk about the problems we face in this diocese unless they ask me. I find that most people are focused forward,"</li>
										<li>"When I arrived it was just me -- a bishop, a cell phone and a car. It was like being a missionary bishop,"</li>
										<li>"I was very intentional about how I wanted to act with him, to approach the meeting with a spirit of Christian reconciliation,"</li>
										<li>"But we have to believe that we're called to do the work that our Lord wants us to do, each in his own way, and not look back."</li>

									<li>Sweigert:
									<ul>

					<blockquote>This spilt affected the parishioners in the Pittsburgh area.  This article asks whether or not the split changed peoples church life.  Some felt the need to move parishes but still felt an attachment to their old church communities.  Others felt a loss of community choosing to keep quiet, worship quietly, and keep to their own opinions.  In most of the cases however the parishes remain friendly with each other despite the theological split.  As for those who had a strong opinion about the split.  This secession allowed for those parishioners to be able to speak their opinion.  The split has offered many conflicting opinions on the subject.</blockquote>
