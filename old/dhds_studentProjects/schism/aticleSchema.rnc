# As you mark up articles, add the names of speakers into the sp and name attributes. If there are any other sects or nationalities, please 
# add those in as well. If you want, you can download this, mark them up, and post a final version of a schema that has all your attribute
# values in. If you do that, I can just combine them, and check all of the articles to make sure they work.
