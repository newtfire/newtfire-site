            <sentence structure="good">This should prove to be interesting. There will probably some sticker shock and awe about increased premium rates and higher deductibles. Any figures on how many of the young and healthy are not signing up, knowing that they don't have to worry about the penalty fee, unless they have a tax refund coming?
                It probably will never be repealed, but I am sure the Republicans will try to redo parts of it, and get rid of the medical equipment tax.</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">ACA is quite popular among those who benefit from it. It is politically impossible to repeal it. The less popular parts of the law like penalties for not carrying insurance will never be enforced. If anything, subsidies will become more generous, cover more people including people illegally here and tourists. There'll be strictures on insurance companies to waive deductibles, abolish the concept of networks etc. A simple tweak to the licensing law will be done to require medical establishments and doctors to accept ACA plans, Medicaid etc. After all, can't the CEOs and doctors and the rich sacrifice a little? And while we're at it, why have the anti-people policy of making premium payments to keep coverage active? Why not force coverage to be automatic and cover all events, so one single monthly premium payment of $100 made one single time covers the person for life?</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">There was speculation when she died of a relatively "routine" surgery that someone who didn't like her jokes and political views may have had something to do with it. Of course all surgery is risky, and given her age, there was more risk. But anyone who wished her gone could've assumed that would deflect any investigation. I don't think she was "done in".

            <sentence structure="good"><acronym>Omg</acronym>! My mouth is on the floor reading this! Bottom line. This clinic, it appears, suffers from not one oversight but a grotesque array of issues that push the border on non-compliance to a new low. Wow. Just Wow. The individuals involved in this procedure need to reach around and cop a good feel of their unravaged anal tissues because it's about to be scathed with hellish pursuit. And rightfully so!
                Foremost; what was going on in that procedure room. I am a critical care registered nurse to lay out my credentials, for my assessment of what went wrong if I'm to read into this story correctly...
                Strike one. No consent! Informed Consent wasn't obtained. <acronym>Omg</acronym>! You didn't even have her legal permission! Wow!
                Strike two. Who are all these people in the procedure room<expunc>!!!</expunc> What a nightmare! She will give you an autograph sowhen she wakes up! <acronym>Omg</acronym>. That's horrifyinonto many levels. People gawking at you while your unconscious<expunc>!!!!!</expunc> Who knows what they were doing, but it's unnerving at best.
                Strike three. How many ENTs does it take to screw in a light bulb<expunc>?!</expunc>
                2/3...or two and a third unpreviledged bloak to be exact. This whole procedure in my mind is this grotesque charade with people taking selfies at the patients bedside. It's after they have had too much fun and overlook her during this absolutely critical time that they bottom out her vitals, from an undoubted overdose of propofol. This along with no compensary or standby hemodynamic support is what caused her death. In layman's terms. They bottomed her vitals out on the sedation (which caused the decrease in BP). They could have easily corrected an over<expunc>-... </expunc>I'll say versus dosage due to misconception of the term. Give her some norepinephrine and stabilize the pressure before proceeding any further. But this isn't done. She bottoms out and we now have a critical condition which should have never happened. This clinic messed up big time. The discrepancy in medical documentation comes from no one person being in charge of this whole nightmare scenario. If there was, they did a pathetic job. No one knows how much propofol was administered?! Who is pushing drugs on her and why?! Where is her nurse?! You better be sure if she were my patient. No one be≈•ter come near her with a syringe of anything without knowledge or immediate say so. This is why I ask. Who was in charge of 'her'. It appears no one was. It is semi the doctors fault, I mean legally it will be them because they<expunc>...</expunc> Geez. Well technically they didn't even assume liability because they don't have a legal consent. <acronym>Smdh</acronym>! So it seems some doctors (3 of them) are shouting out separate orders, no one in charge, in a room full of nonliscensed and licensed personel (who knows who was in there) . It's a wonder this place has even had its door opened this long before this type of situation occurred. It's an awful mess. All the power to the family and state and other regulatory agencies (OSHA and JACHO) who are going to go after this tip top group<expunc>...</expunc> They deserve it. So reach back and cop a good feel ladies and gents <expunc>...</expunc> They are coming.</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">After 15 years working in hospitals, I can say that this happens so much more frequently than people would believe. I know that this took place in a free standing clinic but it is still very similar to a hospital. Hospitals and doctors do their best to cover it up, and if they can't, both the hospital and doctor(s) then try and locate someone lower on the food chain to blame. Then, if that doesn't work, the hospital and doctors turn on one another. The point to this is that when a physician is actually held accountable it's usually because they can't find someone else to take the fall.</sentence>

                What Social Conservative idiots refuse to comprehend, is that allowing the same sex couples to marry poses no "moral threat" to them and others at all.
                According to these nuts, we should be passing laws and fines on those who engage in pre marital sex. The fact that their neighbors are allowed to engage in per-martial sex bothers them, according to their petty "logic".
                Should we then look for Candidates who promise to defend marital and or godly sex and "morally cleanse" America? Why do they cherry pick sins?
                Who is forcing these nuts to divorce their spouse to go marry someone of the same sex? Who is telling them to do anything that would cause them to "cross the moral line"?</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">I have several conservative friends. Most of my family votes Republican. Not one of them is against gay marriage. This will only increase. From now on, a GOP candidate that is virulently anti-gay will only have a shrinking number of folks who will support him or her. It's time for the GOP to come out of the Dark Ages on this issue. Voters such as myself have not voted Republican for decades due to their stances on social issues (among others, of course). I'd be much more likely to consider a Republican if they'd stop being ignorant when it comes to gay folks. It's way past time to stop the idiocy.</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">I have read many good comments here but this is basically one group wanting to impose their morality on another group.  There is nothing American about such an idea and it goes against the freedom of (and from) religion clause in the US Constitution.  Don't like gay marriage, then don't allow it in your religious institutions.  But your religious restrictions have no place in our government, and each and every citizen is entitled to the full protection and benefits of the law.  That includes those granted in the case of marriage. Marriage needs to be a legal union of two people, not a religious expression. </sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">From the article: Experts have said all along it‚Äôs not unusual to get a negative test for Ebola the first time. It takes a while for the virus to build up in the blood. Smith said people usually develop fever about a week after infection. ‚ÄúIf you check right then, often you get a false negative,‚Äù Smith told a news conference. ‚ÄúUsually you have fever for three to four days, then you start getting other symptoms like diarrhea, nausea and vomiting,‚Äù he added. That‚Äôs when patients then almost always test positive. If there‚Äôs enough virus in the blood to set off a positive test, it‚Äôs also enough to cause more advanced symptoms. So, wait, that Ebola Nurse Kaci said she was totally safe because she'd tested negative<expunc>...</expunc> yeah, about that<expunc>...</expunc></sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">Most people think Dr Martin Salia was a hero for treating Ebola patients in West African countries, risking his own health and life. Some people think he deserved treatment in the USA because he was a hero, and a legal US resident, and because "We can". Who thinks it was wise to bring someone in the end stage of the disease to the USA, when he was most infectious, just so his family could cremate or bury him here? Especially since in the end stage, care is strictly palliative, relieving pain and symptoms, making someone more comfortable before they die, without attempting to cure the patient. Why risk giving Ebola traction in America?</sentence>

            <sentence structure="good">Since we're being trivial here, a common definition of poignant is: causing a strong feeling of sadness.  As NBC used the term, "a poignant series of images", this is perfectly appropriate. It may not cause a feeling of sadness on your part, but for many people it does.Also, the probe is not "bouncing on a rock in the void of space".  At least not any longer.

I don't claim to have any expertise in the law. But one thing I do understand is psychology.

I also understand the psychology of victims, and of why a rape victim may stay silent for years and only muster the courage to speak up later. Most importantly, I understand the psychology of the public. The public needs answers. That is precisely the reason why he should deal with the accusations again. If he is innocent, he needs to take responsibility to fight off these accusations. He signed up for the role of "role model" and now he needs to fulfill it. And if the accusations surface again in 5 years, he will owe it to the public to fight them yet again. That is the price of fame.</sentence>

With that said a lot of Paul in this trailer isnt him at all. Get used to it fans. I think the only real shots of him were in the beginning, and that glamour shot with Vin. Everything else is body doubles. I think the shot at 2:13 is most definitely a rendered double.</sentence>
