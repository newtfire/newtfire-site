sentence = element sentence {mixed{structure, (caps | expunc | acronym | obscenity | emote)*}} #This identifies the sentences, regardless of how poorly structured, within the comment element.

emote = element emote {text} #This identifies any emotes the commenter uses, such as :) or <3 or any attempt at making a picture using symbols (such as a multiple line ASCII image made from text and symbols). Since these may use reserved characters, remember to use &lt; for <, &gt; for >, etc.
