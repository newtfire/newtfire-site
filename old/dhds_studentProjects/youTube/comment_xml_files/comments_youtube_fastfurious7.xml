            <sentence structure="good">As 25-30% of this movie was shot with Paul most of these glamour shots are not him but his brothers with cgi rendering and digital voice dubbing similar to what was done in Tron Legacy. With that said a lot of Paul in this trailer isnt him at all. Get used to it fans. I think the only real shots of him were in the beginning, and that glamour shot with Vin. Everything else is body doubles. I think the shot at 2:13 is most definitely a rendered double.</sentence>

                El solo hecho de pensar que ya Paul Walker está muerto, me haría llorar durante toda la película.
