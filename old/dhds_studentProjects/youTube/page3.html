  <h1>Comment Analysis</h1>
	<p>Below we took the comments from each of the videos and articles and tabulated what percentage of them were positive, negative or neutral. As you can see, the results are surprising!</p>
<hr />
<p><iframe width="800" height="600" src="tone_bargraph_svg.svg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>This bar graph shows the tone percentages for all comments across both the Youtube videos and NBC news articles. Predictably, there is much negativity.</p>

<hr />
<p><iframe width="800" height="600" src="tone_bargraph_svg_youtube.svg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>This bar graph shows the tone percentages just for the comments from Youtube videos. Unexpectedly, they are mostly positive!</p>

<hr />

<p><iframe width="800" height="600" src="tone_bargraph_svg_nbc.svg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>And here we can see that it is actually the NBC news articles that contain the highest percentage of negative comments to positive and neutral.</p>

<p><iframe width="800" height="600" src="quality_bargraph_svg.svg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p><p>Here we see how the quality of the comments compares between Youtube and NBC. As we can see, although NBC has more negative comments, its comments are overwhelmingly well-formed, whereas Youtube has about as many poorly written comments as it does well-written ones.
