			<h2><b>Regex Exercise 1</b> </h2>
			<ul>
			  <li>Read and consult <b><a
										href="https://pitt.box.com/s/a1sukx2ckg11x7qh9e5d">our notes
			    on how to work with Autotagging and Regular Expressions
			    (regex)--posted in Box</a></b>.</li>
			  <li>Autotagging and Regex Exercise: Take this <a
									href="https://pitt.box.com/s/g7lreivogcw66fvtpo32">plain-text
			    version of the table of contents of Johann Forster's voyage
			    account (in Box)</a>: Paste its contents into oXygen.<br />
			    <br />
			  </li>
			  <li>Autotag this file to achieve these results (in <a
									href="https://pitt.box.com/s/m8745s0zx3iessc8p9t4">our model XML
			    file</a>), and <b>record each step of your process
			      carefully</b>, either in a plain text file or Microsoft Word. All of
			    your XML files should look the same as our final result, but even if
			    you have have trouble, what's MOST important is that <b>you document
			      the steps you took</b>. We're grading your explanation of how
			    you got from the text file to the final XML form. These will include
			    global Find-and-Replace operations in oXygen (using Ctrl-F on
			    Windows or command-F on Mac). <br />
			    <br />
			  </li>
			  <li><b>Your output should look <a
										href="https://pitt.box.com/s/m8745s0zx3iessc8p9t4">like this
			    XML file for Johann Forster's table of contents</a> (and
			    look at the coding on this). </b>That is, each entry on the
			    table of contents should be its own element, and follow the list
			    structure we've used here: Notice how lists are nested inside lists
			    at multiple levels!<br />
			    <br />
              </li>
			  <li><b>Upload on Courseweb:</b> 1) the document in which you recorded
			    your steps (either a text file or a Word document, whichever is
			    convenient), and 2) the your end result XML file. (Sure, it should
			    look like ours, but if you had trouble with the autotagging this
			    will help us spot problems.) </li>
