		<h2>The Text:</h2>
		<p>For this assignment, work with the plain-text Project Guteberg file of <a href="wildeEarnest.txt">Oscar Wilde's play, <i>The Importance of Being Earnest</i></a>. Download the file, open it in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, and remove the Project Gutenberg boilerplate at the top and bottom of the file, so that you have only the text of the play to work with</p>
		
		<h2>Your Task:</h2>
		<p>Your goal is to use Find/Replace operations to prepare an XML-encoded digital edition of the play. This time, the specific markup tags you us are up to you, but we expect to see specific structural distinctions marked in your XML. These include the following:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>character and cast lists</li>
			<li>acts</li>
			<li>scenes</li>
			<li>speeches</li>
			<li>speakers</li>
			<li>stage directions (cues for the actors and stage managers)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Your goal is to use Find and Replace operations, with or without regular expression patterns, to create <em>descriptive</em> (rather than presentational) XML markup. (We would write an XSLT transformation to convert this to an HTML digital edition for presentation. But this particular task is to make the XML that identifies, holds, and nests the structural units of the play (Acts holding Scenes, Speeches holding info identifying Speakers, etc.). You should not use manual tagging except in situations that occur so rarely that there is really no point in using an autotagging solution. (For example, you do not need to use an autotagging strategy to tag the title of the whole play or to create a root element for your XML: just do that manually.)</p>		
		
	
			<ul>
				
 
			  <li><strong>Record each step of your process carefully</strong>, in a separate document (ideally a plain text file), since this is the
			    file we will be grading. These will include global Find-and-Replace
			    operations or Regular Expressions in oXygen (using Ctrl-F on Windows
			    or command-F on Mac). Your goal is to produce an XML document like our model, but even if you have have trouble, what's most
			    important is that you document the steps you took.</li>
			  <li><strong>Upload two files on Courseweb for this exercise:</strong> 
			  	
			  <ol>	<li>the document in which you recorded your
			    steps (either a text file or a Word document, whichever is
			    convenient), </li>
			 <li>your end result: the XML file you create</li></ol>
			  </li>
