			<h3>XSLT: eXtensible Stylesheet Language: Transformations</h3>
			<p>XSLT is designed to transform XML into other kinds of XML, including HTML. First
				designed in 1999, it co-evolved with XPath, with working groups at the W3 Consortium
				collaborating on both. By 2007, both XPath and XSLT were well integrated together,
				which made XSLT a very powerful transformation language, capable of executing very
				precise manipulations and functions in remixing XML documents. That is really what
				XSLT is for: It is called a <em>stylesheet language</em>, which might remind you of
					<a href="explainCSS.html">CSS (Cascading Stylesheets)</a>, CSS is very limited
				by comparison with XSLT. CSS cannot change the order of elements or the content of a
				document, but instead simply styles the elements already in place, as its functions
				are limited to presentation and display. XSLT, by contrast, can generate new kinds
				of documents from a base XML file, and was designed to translate one form of XML
				into another form (as, for example: XML to XHTML, TEI to XHTML, XML to SVG (scalable
				vector graphics, a form of XML that plots lines and shapes), or XML to KML (or
					<em>Keyhole Markup Language</em>, a form of XML designed for plotting placemarks
				and routes on Google Earth and other map interfaces.</p>
			<p>XSLT is a kind of XML document, with a single root element, <span class="code"
					>&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span> that contains some very important attributes that
				define what the XSLT is transforming, from what and into what. Following that is an
					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:output&gt;</span> statement that sets rules for the
				output document. Then the rest of the document is typically a series of <span
					class="code">&lt;xsl:template&gt;</span> rules, which are written to
					<strong>match</strong> on particular elements of the input document. The way
				XSLT does this is different from most programming languages, which describe a set
				order or procedure. By contrast, XSLT is a <em>declarative language</em>, which
				means that its template rules <em>declare</em> what to do in the event a particular
				element shows up in the document: The rules seek to match specific scenarios: If
				there is a <span class="code">&lt;name&gt;</span> element, and a template rule to
				match, <span class="code">&lt;template match="name"&gt;</span>, the rule will
				&#8220;fire&#8221; and generate output according to scenario you have written in the
				template. (So, for example, you might write a template rule that matches on all
					<span class="code">&lt;name&gt;</span> elements in an XML file, and outputs them
				all in an HTML list. Inside an <span class="code">&lt;xsl:template&gt;</span> is
				typically an <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates&gt;</span> rule which
				effectively calls on one or more of the elements in a file to be match the next
				appropriate template for them.</p>
			<p>To get started writing an XSLT file in &lt;oXygen/&gt; go to File&#8594;New Document,
				and choose XSLT. Typically we write and run XSLT in oXygen using the &#8220;XSLT
				debugger&#8221; view, which we show you in the graphic below. In that view, we
				choose an input file and an XSLT file to run, select a kind of output, and produce
				it in the output window on the right: </p>
			<div class="wideImage"><img src="oXygenXSLTscrn1.png" alt="screen capture in oXygen of XSLT debugger"/></div>
			<h3>XSLT&#8217;s Built-in Rules</h3>
			<p>You don&#8217;t have to write any rules at all in XSLT. You could simply write a stylesheet
				with no template rules, and it would output all of the plain text of your document.
				That&#8217;s because XSLT has built-in rules that by default with output text nodes
				of all elements. The built-in rules start at the root of the element, and unless
				they are told to stop or diverted by template rules they will walk the whole XML
				tree and output any text they find. </p>
			<h3>XSLT Stylesheet and Output Elements</h3>
			<p>If you open an XSLT stylesheet in &lt;oXygen/&gt;, as of late 2014 you will see this
				opening and root element. We will usually need to alter this a little: </p>
			<div class="code"> &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br /> &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"<br />
				<span class="indent">xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><br />
				<span class="indent">xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math"</span><br />
				<span class="indent">exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"</span><br />
				<span class="indent">version="3.0"&gt;</span><br />
				<br /> &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; </div>
			<p>The part of this we need to alter are the <span class="code">@xmlns</span>
				attributes, usually to add something more. These are the <strong>namespace</strong>
				declarations, which indicate the namespaces of the file from which we are reading
				(our input XML document), and the output we are writing to (XML or HTML, etc). When
				things go very badly wrong in XSLT and no output is generated at all, it is nearly
				always a namespace issue: you may have forgotten to include the appropriate
				namespaces! For example, in our work on the Digital Mitford project, and in some of
				your homework exercises, you will need to be reading from the TEI namespace and be
				outputting to XHTML: To do that you must add the appropriate attributes to the <span
					class="code">&lt;xsl:stylesheet&gt;</span>, indicating that TEI is the default
					<strong>XPath namespace</strong> and that the XHTML namespace applies as well.
				Here is our series of declarations:</p>
			<div class="code"> &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br /> &lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"<br />
				<span class="indent"><span class="code"
						>xpath-default-namespace="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"</span></span><br />
				<span class="indent">xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><br />
				<span class="indent">xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math"</span><br />
				<span class="indent">exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"</span><br />
				<span class="indent"><span class="code"
					>xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"</span></span><br />
				<span class="indent">version="3.0"&gt;</span><br />
				<br /> &lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; </div>
			<p>Of course we don&#8217;t bother to memorize this, and typically copy and paste the
				namespace values from one file to the next (or by consulting pages like this
				one)!</p>
			<h4>The Output Statement</h4>
			<p>We need to write another &#8220;top-level&#8221; statement (an immediate child of
				the root element) that indicates the kind of output the XSLT file is generating.
				(This is necessary to output a valid HTML 5 document written in XML syntax.) The
					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:output/&gt;</span> element is self-closing, and its
				first attribute, <span class="code">@method</span> needs to designate one of the
				following options as its value: "xml" (which is the default), "xhtml", "html", and
				"text". We set "xml" here when outputting HTML 5 to avoid validation errors in our output. There are other attributes to place
				on the output statement, which we&#8217;ll explain by walking through this
				example:</p>
			<div class="code"> &lt;xsl:output method="xml" encoding="utf-8" indent="yes"<br />
				doctype-system="about:legacy-compat"/&gt; </div>
			<p>The method is set to xml . We set <span class="code">@encoding</span> to utf-8,
				because it&#8217;s the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8">universal
					Unicode character set</a>, the most widely compatible character set for use on
				the World Wide Web. We usually set <span class="code">@indent</span> to "yes" (and
				the other legal value is "no"): This controls whether long lines of text in your
				output may be &#8220;wrapped&#8221; or indented on new lines, which typically makes
				them easier for humans to read. The last attribute, <span class="code">@doctype-system</span>, must be set to generate an HTML 5 doctype declaration in your output. <span class="smaller">(This precise setting of the @doctype-system attribute is currently, as of December 2014, the easiest way in XSLT to generate the current doctype statement for HTML 5, and the &#8220;about:legacy-compat&#8221; part of it is actually for compatibility with software that outputs HTML rather than compatibility with browsers.)</span></p>
			<h4>White Space: Preserve or Destroy</h4>
			<p>The last top-level elements we need to tell you about are for controlling white space
				in your output. These are optional, but occasionally really necessary depending on
				the output you need and the state of your source file: </p>
			<div class="code"> &lt;xsl:strip-space elements="day month year"/&gt;<br /><br />
				&lt;xsl:preserve-space elements="p li name"/&gt; </div>
			<p>Use <span class="code">xsl:strip-space</span> to remove white space inside the
				elements in the list. Notice that the attribute (<span class="code"
				>@elements</span>) takes a space-delimited list of element names. The idea is that
				you may need to remove extra spaces in the text of some of your elements, such as
				new-line characters and indentations at beginnings of lines, so you use strip-space
				to systematically remove them all. By contrast, you&#8217;d use <span class="code"
					>xsl:preserve-space</span> to keep the white space.</p>
			<p>Usually we don&#8217;t need these elements, but when you need it, you will know, because
				your output will have too much white space, or your formatting will be all
				wrong.</p>
			<h3>Template Rules</h3>
			<p>The main part of the XSLT stylesheet are its template rules. When you write an <span
					class="code">xsl:template</span>, you specify an <span class="code"
					>@match</span> attribute which calls out to particular elements. The value of
				@match can be described as <em>&#8220;XPath-like&#8221;</em>: it&#8217;s not really a full
				XPath expression, but it uses XPath syntax. This is because we do not designate the
				template <span class="code">@match</span> to walk down the XML document tree. No.
				Instead, the elements <em>come to the template rule</em>, and if you were to write a
				full XPath expression with the leading // to designate walking down from the root,
				that would have no effect. With xsl:template rules, the elements in the input XML
				are matched out of context with their hierarchy. For example, if you have written a
				template match for <span class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="div"&gt;</span>, that
				rule is going to &#8220;fire&#8221; any time a <span class="code">div </span>comes
				by from the source document. </p>
			<p>That can be really useful if we want a template rule to match all the divs in the
				hierarchy and treat them the same way. But usually that is not what we want. This is
				where the <em>&#8220;XPath-like&#8221;</em> syntax comes in: In the Hamlet XML file
				we sometimes work with in homework exercises, you may want to process Acts (<span
					class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> elements directly under the <span class="code"
					>&lt;body&gt;</span>) differently from Scenes (<span class="code"
					>&lt;div&gt;</span> elements directly under Acts), and so, using XPath-like
				syntax for <span class="code">@match</span>, you can write one template rule for
					<span class="code">match="body/div"</span> and another for <span class="code"
					>match="div/div"</span>. You can also use predicates; for example, to process
				only Hamlet’s speeches, you can write a rule for <span class="code">xsl:template
					match="sp[@who eq &#8217;Hamlet&#8217;]"</span>. Those template rules will only match on
				special cases as they come up.</p>
			<p>To write a complete template rule, you have to call for a particular kind of node in
				your document (usually an element, but maybe other things), and then you have to do
				some action with it. The action usually creates output nodes, and then goes on to
					<strong>apply templates</strong> to the children of the current context node
				that has come by. So, to output a line of poetry in the form of an HTML paragraph,
				just to preserve the lines, you could write the following template rule:</p>
			<div class="code"> &lt;xsl:template match="line"&gt;<br />
				<span class="indent">&lt;p&gt;</span><br />
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span><br />
				<span class="indent">&lt;/p&gt;</span><br /> &lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br />
			</div>
			<p>Here is what happens when this rule fires: A <span class="code">&lt;line&gt;</span>
				element drifts by this template rule and is caught by the <span class="code"
					>@match</span> attribute. The template takes its contents (basically consumes
				the node), and in its place it outputs an HTML <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span>.
				What&#8217;s inside that <span class="code">&lt;p&gt;</span> element generates its
				contents: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> by itself with no
				attributes says, process the contents of this element it is consuming. <span
					class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> will process the contents of
					<span class="code">&lt;line&gt;</span> and pass its child nodes on to the
				templates that apply to them. </p>
			<p>You might want to process something in particular in a template rule, to direct <span
					class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> to a next element that you want
				to be consumed in this particular position: perhaps something specific you would want to see
				next within the HTML element you are constructing, to restrict what comes next. For example, say you are working with our <a href="ForsterGeorgComplete.xml">Georg Forster Pacific Voyage text coded in TEI</a>, and you only want output a list of place names (coded with <span class="code">&lt;placeName&gt;</span> in each chapter, inside an HTML unordered list (coded with an outer <span class="list">ul</span> and an inner series of <span class="list">li</span> (list items), with an outer list containing the Chapter headings and an inner list for each chapter holding the <span class="code">&lt;placeName&gt;</span> elements within it. For this transformation from TEI we are going to need three template rules, to sit at different levels of our stylesheet. Here&#8217;s how we handled it:</p>
			
			<div class="code">
				&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;<br/>
				&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"<br/>
					<span class="indent">xmlns:xs="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"</span><br/>
					<span class="indent">xmlns:math="http://www.w3.org/2005/xpath-functions/math" exclude-result-prefixes="xs math"</span><br/>
					<span class="indent">xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" version="3.0"</span><br/>
					<span class="indent">xpath-default-namespace="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"&gt;</span><br/>
				
				&lt;xsl:output method="xhtml" indent="yes" doctype-system="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd"/&gt;<br/>
					
					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;</span><br/>
					<span class="indent">&lt;html&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;head&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indentEvMore">&lt;title&gt;Places Mentioned in Georg Forster Account&lt;/title&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;/head&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indent">&lt;body&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;h1&gt;Places Listed in Each Chapter of Georg Forster&#8217;s Voyage Record&lt;/h1&gt;</span><br/>
								
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;ul&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="code"><span class="indentEvMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="//text/body//div[@type=&#8217;chapter&#8217;]"/&gt;</span></span><br/>
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;/ul&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indent">&lt;/body&gt;</span><br/>
							
				<span class="indent">&lt;/html&gt;</span><br/>
							<span class="code">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span><br/>
					
					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="div[@type='chapter']"&gt;</span><br/>
						
				<span class="indent">&lt;li&gt;</span><br/>
							<span class="code"><span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="head/l"/&gt;</span></span><br/>
							
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;ul&gt;</span><br/>
							<span class="code"><span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=".//placeName"/&gt;</span></span><br/>
				<span class="indentMore">&lt;/ul&gt;</span><br/>	
							<span class="indent">&lt;/li&gt;</span><br/>
						
						<span class="code">&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</span><br/>
					
					<span class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="placeName"&gt;</span><br/>
					
					<span class="indentMore">&lt;li&gt;<span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span>&lt;/li&gt;</span><br/>
					
						
						&lt;/xsl:template&gt;<br/>
						&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt; 			
			</div>
			<p>In the stylesheet above, notice that the <span class="code">@select</span> attribute on <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates</span> is a <strong>literal XPath expression</strong>. In the template rule matching <span class="code">div @type="chapter"</span> we see two ways of stepping down into a literal XPath from the current context node, whatever it is. In the first <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span>, we step into a child node and then down another path step to the child of head: <span class="code">head/l</span>. In the second <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span>, we use the "dot" notation to indicate the current context node, which is very important because our <span class="code">//</span> descendent axis notation would otherwise be read as starting from the root of the XML tree and heading all the way down, rather than reading within a specific chapter! <span class="code">xsl:apply-templates @select</span> is a literal XPath expression, quite unlike what we described with the <em>&#8220;XPath-like&#8221;</em> syntax in
				the template&#8217;s <span class="code">@match</span>.</p>
			<h4>Calculating and Outputting XPath Functions</h4>
			<p>If we wanted to calculate a <span class="code">count()</span> or take the <span class="code">distinct-values()</span> of a series of output elements, or calculate and output <span class="code">string-length()</span> of a node, or otherwise execute XPath functions, we would write something like this: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:value-of select="count(placeName)"/&gt;</span>, to deliver the <strong>calculated value</strong> of something. We would use this in place of our usual <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span></p>
			<h4>Totally suppressing a node:</h4>
			<p>One way not to output anything for an element is to write an empty template rule for it! For example, you could ensure that none of your paragraphs were ever output if you wrote the following:</p> 
				<div class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="p"/&gt;
				
				
				</div>
			<p>This works to suppress the built-in rule to output text when no rules are defined, and effectively suppresses your paragraphs. </p>
			
			
		<h4>XSLT Processing: Understanding the Difference between <span class="code">@match</span> and <span class="code">@select</span>:</h4>
			<p>Use <span class="code">@match</span> only when we&#8217;re defining a template rule.</p>  
			<div class="code">	&lt;xsl:template <span class="code">match="a-pattern-wherever-it-is-that-we-want-to-match"</span>&gt;<br/>

					<span class="indent">INSIDE HERE we do stuff to process what we&#8217;ve matched, and we instruct XSLT what to do next from this point in the document.</span><br/>
					
					&lt;/xsl:template/&gt;<br/>
				</div>
			<p>We use <span class="code">@select</span> in the internal part, on one of two XSLT elements: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> or <span class="code">&lt;xsl:value-of/&gt;</span>.</p>
				
				
				
			<div class="code">			&lt;xsl:template match="something-wherever-it-is-that-we-want-to-match"&gt;
					
					
					<span class="indent">&lt;NEW-ELEMENT&gt;  &lt;!--this is the new element we want to show up in the transformed document--&gt;</span><br/>
					<span class="indentMore">&lt;xsl:apply-templates <span class="code">select="something-related-by-XPath-to-this-point-we&#8217;ve-matched</span>&gt;</span><br/>
				<span class="indent">&lt;/NEW-ELEMENT&gt;</span>
				&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</div>
				
			<p>We don&#8217;t have to use <span class="code">@select</span> at all! We could simply go with <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> if we want to duplicate ALL the contents of the thing we&#8217;ve matched in this place.  We use <span class="code">@select</span> when we need to be <strong>selective</strong> about what we&#8217;re going to process at the points of our match. So, let&#8217;s think about this with a couple of examples, one that uses <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span> with NO <span class="code">@select</span> attribute, and one that uses <span class="code">@select</span>.</p>
				
			<p><strong>Example 1: simple <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt;</span>  (no <span class="code">@select</span>):</strong></p>
				
				<div class="code">
					&lt;xsl:template match="div/div//head"&gt;<br/>
					
					<span class="indent">&lt;h1&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates/&gt; &lt;/h1&gt;</span><br/>
					
					&lt;/xsl:template&gt;
				</div>
				
				
			<p>This template rule makes an <span class="code">@match</span> on something "XPath-like":  We use XPath syntax to define it, but notice that it is NOT a full XPath expression, because we can&#8217;t see where it originates: we haven&#8217;t defined a path down to it from the root element. But what we&#8217;re doing is looking for a pattern, wherever it turns up in the XML tree: wherever we see a <span class="code">div/div//head</span> (or a head element that sits in a configuration like this), go match on it, whether it appears up near the root element, or down inside a body paragraph).  When we are there, the rule says, output an &lt;h1&gt; HTML element (for a top-level heading in HTML), and inside output the full contents of our XML &lt;head&gt; element, and then go on and process any children of head by the other template rules I&#8217;ve written in this XSLT file: Apply templates from this point on down the XML tree.</p>
					
					<p>vs.</p>
			<p><strong>Example 2: <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select=".//something"&gt;</span>  using <span class="code">@select</span> (when and why we do it):</strong></p>
						
			<div class="code">&lt;xsl:template match="placeName"&gt;<br/>
							
							<span class="indent">&lt;strong&gt; &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"/&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;</span><br/>
							
							&lt;/xsl:template&gt;</div>
						
			<p>This rule says, first of all, make a template <span class="code">@match</span> on <strong>any</strong> <span class="code">placeName</span>, wherever it appears in my XML input file. When you are there, <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"&gt;</span> says, go and process <strong>selectively</strong>: We don&#8217;t want the whole output here: What we want is ONLY the contents of the @ref attribute sitting on <span class="code">&lt;placeName ref="Someplace"&gt;text-content-here &lt;/placeName&gt;</span>.  The template rule will go and read the contents of the <span class="code">@ref</span> attribute and output it here in the transformed HTML, wrapped in a <span class="code">&lt;strong&gt;</span> element to present it as bold. <span class="code">&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="@ref"&gt;</span> also says "go and apply the other template rules on this sheet to any children of <span class="code">placeName</span> (if there are any).</p>
							
							<p>Think of <span class="code">@select</span> this way:</p>
			<div class="code">	&lt;xsl:apply-templates select="XPath-from-this-point"&gt; </div>
			<p>Wherever our template rule has matched, the <span class="code">apply-templates @select</span> expresses <strong>a definite XPath from that point</strong>—usually to a child element or to an attribute, or to some specific point that you want to process so that you <strong>don&#8217;t</strong> output the full content of the thing the template has matched on.  Use <span class="code">@select</span> when you want to define very specific output.</p>
